<a name="_page8_x0.00_y0.00"></a>**FOREWORD**

“The CT scan is normal,” the emergency department physician explains to the resident. “I'm thinking of sending the patient home, but I've only done a cursory examination.” Ten minutes later, the resident returns. “The patient had a stroke. She has a positive Homans sign and a positive Babinski's reflex. Arrange a room.”

As this type of drama plays out every day in hospitals and clinics, eliciting a thorough history and performing a careful examination continue to be the cornerstones of clinical practice. Despite marked improvements in technology, the patient assessment is based on both subtle history clues and an observant exam. This still yields the highest diagnostic results, not to mention the cost- benefit ratio and the rapport it establishes with the patient. Those clues should always direct the technology, not the other way around.

*Handbook of Signs & Symptoms*, Fifth Edition, is a treasure trove of prompts and reminders for the clinician. It provides a comprehensive description of common to unusual patient complaints, coupled with diagnostic testing that is both routine and specific. It describes physical examination findings in detail and clarifies the mechanics of performing even rarely used tests.

Signs and symptoms are formatted alphabetically for quick retrieval, and elicited history is linked to the essentials of the exam. Readers are alerted to urgent situations in the Emergency Interventions section. Differential diagnoses are listed under Medical Causes, following the elaboration of the symptom history and exam findings. Under the heading Other Causes, the clinician is alerted to medications or herbal remedies that are associated with the patient's complaint. Special Considerations address pediatric, gender-specific, and geriatric concerns.

This new edition of the handbook has been updated to include important signs and symptoms related to diseases that have recently taken center stage in clinical medicine, including avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Kawasaki disease, and metabolic syndrome — an epidemic disease that has become essential to diagnose and manage.

Illustrations are scattered throughout the book to augment the reader's understanding of particular tests, and tables point out the often subtle differences in signs and symptoms to help distinguish among the most common complaints. These visual graphics make great teaching tools, too. The index is invaluable to the reader looking for a particular, familiar exam finding as well as for the differential utilizing that finding. The addition of a new appendix that focuses on obtaining a health history answers the need for comprehensive, reliable, and consistent documentation information that is important to formatting electronic medical records.

*Handbook of Signs & Symptoms*, Fifth Edition, sharpens the novice clinician's ability to listen to the patient with an ear tuned to critical history and offers the seasoned clinician an opportunity to hone examination skills. It is an invaluable tool for maximizing the evaluation of a puzzling patient. Following the handbook's format provides the clinician with an added measure of security that the most careful history and educated examination have been performed.

**Abdominal Distention**

**(See Also Abdominal Mass, Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Rigidity)**

Abdominal distention refers to increased abdominal girth — the result of increased intra-abdominal pressure forcing the abdominal wall outward. Distention may be mild or severe, depending on the amount of pressure. It may be localized or diffuse and may occur gradually or suddenly. Acute abdominal distention may signal life-threatening peritonitis or acute bowel obstruction.

Abdominal distention may result from fat, flatus, a fetus (pregnancy or intra- abdominal mass [ectopic pregnancy]), or fluid. Fluid and gas are normally present in the GI tract but not in the peritoneal cavity. However, if fluid and gas can’t pass freely through the GI tract, abdominal distention occurs. In the peritoneal cavity, distention may reflect acute bleeding, accumulation of ascitic fluid, or air from perforation of an abdominal organ.

Abdominal distention doesn’t always signal pathology. For example, in anxious patients or those with digestive distress, localized distention in the left upper quadrant can result from aerophagia — the unconscious swallowing of air. Generalized distention can result from ingestion of fruits or vegetables with large quantities of unabsorbable carbohydrates, such as legumes, or from abnormal food fermentation by microbes. Don’t forget to rule out pregnancy in all females with abdominal distention.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient displays abdominal distention, quickly check for signs of hypovolemia, such as pallor, diaphoresis, hypotension, a rapid thready pulse, rapid shallow breathing, decreased urine output, and altered*


*mentation. Ask the patient if he’s experiencing severe abdominal pain or difficulty breathing. Find out about any recent accidents, and observe him for signs of trauma and peritoneal bleeding, such as Cullen’s sign or Turner’s sign. Then, auscultate all abdominal quadrants, noting rapid and high-pitched, diminished, or absent bowel sounds. (If you don’t hear bowel sounds immediately, listen for at least 5 minutes in each of the four abdominal quadrants.) Gently palpate the abdomen for rigidity. Remember that deep or extensive palpation may increase pain.*

*If you detect abdominal distention and rigidity along with abnormal bowel sounds and if the patient complains of pain, begin emergency interventions. Place the patient in the supine position, administer oxygen, and insert an I.V. line for fluid replacement. Prepare to insert a nasogastric tube to relieve acute intraluminal distention. Reassure the patient, and prepare him for surgery.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s abdominal distention isn’t acute, ask about its onset and duration and associated signs. A patient with localized distention may report a sensation of pressure, fullness, or tenderness in the affected area. A patient with generalized distention may report a bloated feeling, a pounding heart, and difficulty breathing deeply or when lying flat. (See *Abdominal Distention: Common Causes and Associated Findings*.)

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.016.png)

The patient may also feel unable to bend at his waist. Make sure to ask about abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, altered bowel habits, and weight gain or loss.

Obtain a medical history, noting GI or biliary disorders that may cause peritonitis or ascites, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. (See *Detecting Ascites*, page 4.) Also, note chronic constipation. Has the patient recently had abdominal surgery, which can lead to abdominal distention? Ask about recent accidents, even minor ones, such as falling off a stepladder.

Perform a complete physical examination. Don’t restrict the examination to the abdomen because you could miss important clues to the cause of abdominal distention. Next, stand at the foot of the bed and observe the recumbent patient for abdominal asymmetry to determine if distention is localized or generalized. Then, assess abdominal contour by stooping at his side. Inspect for tense, taut skin and bulging flanks, which may indicate ascites. Observe the umbilicus. An everted umbilicus may indicate ascites or umbilical hernia. An inverted umbilicus may indicate distention from gas; it’s also common in obesity. Inspect the abdomen for signs of inguinal or femoral hernia and for incisions that may point to adhesions. Both may lead to intestinal obstruction. Then, auscultate for bowel sounds, abdominal friction rubs (indicating peritoneal inflammation), and bruits (indicating an aneurysm). Listen for succussion splash — a splashing sound normally heard in the stomach when the patient moves or when palpation disturbs the viscera. However, an abnormally loud splash indicates fluid accumulation, suggesting gastric dilation or obstruction.

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Detecting Ascites![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.018.png)**

To differentiate ascites from other causes of abdominal distention, check for shifting dullness, fluid wave, and puddle sign, as described here.

**SHIFTING DULLNESS**

**Step 1.** With the patient in a supine position, percuss from the umbilicus outward to the flank, as shown. Draw a line on the patient’s skin to mark the change from tympany to dullness.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.019.png)

**Step 2.** Turn the patient onto his side. (Note that this positioning causes ascitic fluid to shift.) Percuss again, and mark the change from tympany to dullness. A difference between these lines can indicate ascites.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.020.png)

**FLUID WAVE![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.021.png)**

Have another person press deeply into the patient’s midline to prevent vibration from traveling along the abdominal wall. Place one of your palms on one of the patient’s flanks. Strike the opposite flank with your other hand. If you feel the blow in the opposite palm, ascitic fluid is present.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.022.png)

**PUDDLE SIGN**

Position the patient on his elbows and knees, which causes ascitic fluid to pool in the most dependent part of the abdomen. Percuss the abdomen from the flank to the midline. The percussion note becomes louder at the edge of the puddle, or the ascitic pool.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.023.png)

Next, percuss and palpate the abdomen to determine if distention results from air, fluid, or both. A tympanic note in the left lower quadrant suggests an air- filled descending or sigmoid colon. A tympanic note throughout a generally distended abdomen suggests an air-filled peritoneal cavity. A dull percussion note throughout a generally distended abdomen suggests a fluid-filled peritoneal cavity. Shifting of dullness laterally with the patient in the decubitus position also indicates a fluid-filled abdominal cavity. A pelvic or intra-abdominal mass causes local dullness upon percussion and should be palpable. Obesity causes a large abdomen without shifting dullness, prominent tympany, or palpable bowel or other masses, with generalized rather than localized dullness.

Palpate the abdomen for tenderness, noting whether it’s localized or generalized. Watch for peritoneal signs and symptoms, such as rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, McBurney’s point, obturator sign, and psoas sign. Female patients should undergo a pelvic examination and males, a genital examination. All patients who report abdominal pain should undergo a digital rectal examination with fecal occult blood testing. Finally, measure the patient’s abdominal girth for a baseline value. Mark the flanks with a felt-tipped pen as a reference for subsequent measurements.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Abdominal cancer.*** Generalized abdominal distention may occur when the cancer — most commonly ovarian, hepatic, or pancreatic — produces ascites (usually in a patient with a known tumor). It’s an indication of advanced disease. Shifting dullness and a fluid wave accompany distention. Associated signs and symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, an abdominal mass, anorexia, jaundice, GI hemorrhage (hematemesis or melena), dyspepsia, and weight loss that progresses to muscle weakness and atrophy.
  - ***Abdominal trauma.*** When brisk internal bleeding accompanies trauma, abdominal distention may be acute and dramatic. Associated signs and symptoms of this life-threatening disorder include abdominal rigidity with guarding, decreased or absent bowel sounds, vomiting, tenderness, and abdominal bruising. Pain may occur over the trauma site or over the scapula if abdominal bleeding irritates the phrenic nerve. Signs of hypovolemic shock (such as hypotension and rapid, thready pulse) appear with significant blood loss.
    - ***Cirrhosis.*** In cirrhosis, ascites causes generalized distention and is confirmed by a fluid wave, shifting dullness, and a puddle sign. Umbilical eversion and caput medusae (dilated veins around the umbilicus) are common. The patient may report a feeling of fullness or weight gain. Associated findings include vague abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, bleeding tendencies, severe pruritus, palmar erythema, spider angiomas, leg edema, and possibly splenomegaly. Hematemesis, encephalopathy, gynecomastia, or testicular atrophy may also be seen. Jaundice is usually a late sign. Hepatomegaly occurs initially, but the liver may not be palpable if the patient has advanced disease.
- ***Heart failure.*** Generalized abdominal distention due to ascites typically accompanies severe cardiovascular impairment and is confirmed by shifting dullness and a fluid wave. Signs and symptoms of heart failure are numerous and depend on the disease stage and degree of cardiovascular impairment. Hallmarks include peripheral edema, jugular vein distention, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Common associated signs and symptoms include hepatomegaly (which may cause right upper quadrant pain), nausea, vomiting, a productive cough, crackles, cool extremities, cyanotic nail beds, nocturia, exercise intolerance, nocturnal wheezing, diastolic hypertension, and cardiomegaly.
  - ***Irritable bowel syndrome.*** Irritable bowel syndrome may produce intermittent, localized distention — the result of periodic intestinal spasms. Lower abdominal pain or cramping typically accompanies these spasms. The pain is usually relieved by defecation or by passage of intestinal gas and is aggravated by stress. Other possible signs and symptoms include diarrhea that may alternate with constipation or normal bowel function, nausea, dyspepsia, straining and urgency at defecation, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and small, mucus-streaked stools.
    - ***Large-bowel obstruction.*** Dramatic abdominal distention is characteristic in this life-threatening disorder; in fact, loops of the large bowel may become visible on the abdomen. Constipation precedes distention and may be the only symptom for days. Associated findings include tympany, high-pitched bowel sounds, and the sudden onset of colicky lower abdominal pain that becomes persistent. Fecal vomiting and diminished peristaltic waves and bowel sounds are late signs.
- ***Mesenteric artery occlusion (acute).*** In this life-threatening disorder, abdominal distention usually occurs several hours after the sudden onset of severe, colicky periumbilical pain accompanied by rapid (even forceful) bowel evacuation. The pain later becomes constant and diffuse. Related signs and symptoms include severe abdominal tenderness with guarding and rigidity, absent bowel sounds and, occasionally, a bruit in the right iliac fossa. The patient may also experience vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, or constipation. Late signs include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and cool, clammy skin. Abdominal distention or GI bleeding may be the only clue if pain is absent.
- ***Paralytic ileus.*** Paralytic ileus, which produces generalized distention with a tympanic percussion note, is accompanied by absent or hypoactive bowel sounds and, occasionally, mild abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient may be severely constipated or may pass flatus and small, liquid stools.
  - ***Peritonitis.*** Peritonitis is a life-threatening disorder in which abdominal distention may be localized or generalized, depending on the extent of the inflammation. Fluid accumulates within the peritoneal cavity and then within the bowel lumen, causing a fluid wave and shifting dullness. Typically, distention is accompanied by sudden and severe abdominal pain that worsens with movement, rebound tenderness, and abdominal rigidity. The skin over the patient’s abdomen may appear taut. Associated signs and symptoms usually include hypoactive or absent bowel sounds, fever, chills, hyperalgesia, nausea, and vomiting. Signs of shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension, appear with significant fluid loss into the abdomen.
    - ***Small-bowel obstruction.*** Abdominal distention is characteristic in small- bowel obstruction, a life-threatening disorder, and is most pronounced during late obstruction, especially in the distal small bowel. Auscultation reveals hypoactive or hyperactive bowel sounds, whereas percussion produces a tympanic note. Accompanying signs and symptoms include colicky periumbilical pain, constipation, nausea, and vomiting; the higher the obstruction, the earlier and more severe the vomiting. Rebound tenderness reflects intestinal strangulation with ischemia. Associated signs and symptoms include drowsiness, malaise, and signs of dehydration. Signs of hypovolemic shock appear with progressive dehydration and plasma loss.
- ***Toxic megacolon (acute).*** Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening complication of infectious or ulcerative colitis. It produces dramatic abdominal distention that usually develops gradually and is accompanied by a tympanic percussion note, diminished or absent bowel sounds, and mild rebound tenderness. The patient also presents with abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.

**Special Considerations**

Position the patient comfortably, using pillows for support. Place him on his left

side to help flatus escape. Or, if he has ascites, elevate the head of the bed to ease his breathing. Administer drugs to relieve pain, and offer emotional support.

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as abdominal X-rays, endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography scan or, possibly, paracentesis.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient to use slow breathing to help relieve abdominal discomfort, and emphasize the importance of oral hygiene to prevent dry mouth. If the patient has an obstruction or ascites, tell him which foods and fluids to avoid.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because a young child’s abdomen is normally rounded, distention may be difficult to observe. Fortunately, a child’s abdominal wall is less well developed than an adult’s, making palpation easier. When percussing the abdomen, remember that a child normally swallows air when eating and crying, resulting in louder-than-normal tympany. Minimal tympany with abdominal distention may result from fluid accumulation or solid masses. To check for abdominal fluid, test for shifting dullness instead of a fluid wave. (In a child, air swallowing and incomplete abdominal muscle development make the fluid wave difficult to interpret.)

Sometimes, a child won’t cooperate with a physical examination. Try to gain the child’s confidence, and consider allowing him to remain in the parent’s or caregiver’s lap. You can gather clues by observing the child while he’s coughing, walking, or even climbing on office furniture. Remove all the child’s clothing to avoid missing diagnostic clues. Also, perform a gentle rectal examination.

In neonates, ascites usually result from GI or urinary perforation; in older children, from heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Besides ascites, congenital malformations of the GI tract (such as intussusception and volvulus) may cause abdominal distention. A hernia may cause distention if it produces an intestinal obstruction. In addition, overeating and constipation can cause distention.

**Geriatric Pointers**

As people age, fat tends to accumulate in the lower abdomen and near the hips, even when body weight is stable. This accumulation, together with weakening abdominal muscles, commonly produces a potbelly, which some elderly patients interpret as fluid collection or evidence of disease.

**Abdominal Mass**

**(See Also Abdominal Distention, Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Rigidity)**

Commonly detected on routine physical examination, an abdominal mass is a localized swelling in one abdominal quadrant. Typically, this sign develops insidiously and may represent an enlarged organ, a neoplasm, an abscess, a vascular defect, or a fecal mass.

Distinguishing an abdominal mass from a normal structure requires skillful palpation. At times, palpation must be repeated with the patient in a different position or performed by a second examiner to verify initial findings. A palpable abdominal mass is an important clinical sign and usually represents a serious — and perhaps life-threatening — disorder.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient has a pulsating midabdominal mass and severe abdominal or back pain, suspect an aortic aneurysm. Quickly take his vital signs. Because the patient may require emergency surgery, withhold food or fluids until he’s examined. Prepare to administer oxygen and to start an I.V. infusion for fluid and blood replacement. Obtain routine preoperative tests, and prepare the patient for angiography. Frequently monitor blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and urine output.*

*Be alert for signs of shock, such as tachycardia, hypotension, and cool clammy skin, which may indicate significant blood loss.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s abdominal mass doesn’t suggest an aortic aneurysm, continue with a detailed history. Ask the patient if the mass is painful. If so, ask if the pain is constant or if it occurs only on palpation. Is it localized or generalized? Determine if the patient was already aware of the mass. If he was, find out if he noticed any change in the size or location of the mass.

Next, review the patient’s medical history, paying special attention to GI disorders. Ask the patient about GI symptoms, such as constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abnormally colored stools, and vomiting. Has the patient noticed a change in his appetite? If the patient is female, ask whether her menstrual cycles are regular and when the first day of her last menstrual period was.

A complete physical examination should be performed. Next, auscultate for bowel sounds in each quadrant. Listen for bruits or friction rubs, and check for enlarged veins. Lightly palpate and then deeply palpate the abdomen, assessing any painful or suspicious areas last. Note the patient’s position when you locate the mass. Some masses can be detected only with the patient in a supine position; others require a sidelying position.

Estimate the size of the mass in centimeters. Determine its shape. Is it round or sausage shaped? Describe its contour as smooth, rough, sharply defined, nodular, or irregular. Determine the consistency of the mass. Is it doughy, soft, solid, or hard? Also, percuss the mass. A dull sound indicates a fluid-filled mass and a tympanic sound, an air-filled mass.

Next, determine if the mass moves with your hand or in response to respiration. Is the mass free-floating or attached to intra-abdominal structures? To determine whether the mass is located in the abdominal wall or the abdominal cavity, ask the patient to lift his head and shoulders off the examination table, thereby contracting his abdominal muscles. While these muscles are contracted, try to palpate the mass. If you can, the mass is in the abdominal wall; if you can’t, the mass is within the abdominal cavity. (See *Abdominal Masses: Locations and Common Causes*, page 10.)

After the abdominal examination is complete, perform pelvic, genital, and rectal examinations.

**Medical Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.024.png) ***Abdominal aortic aneurysm.*** Abdominal aortic aneurysm may persist for years, producing only a pulsating periumbilical mass with a systolic bruit over the aorta. However, it may become life threatening if the aneurysm expands and its walls weaken. In such cases, the patient initially reports constant upper abdominal pain or, less commonly, low back or dull abdominal pain. If the aneurysm ruptures, he’ll report severe abdominal and back pain. After rupture, the aneurysm no longer pulsates.

Associated signs and symptoms of rupture include mottled skin below the waist, absent femoral and pedal pulses, lower blood pressure in the legs than in the arms, mild to moderate tenderness with guarding, and abdominal rigidity. Signs of shock — such as tachycardia and cool, clammy skin — appear with significant blood loss.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.028.png) ***Cholecystitis.*** Deep palpation below the liver border may reveal a smooth,

firm, sausage-shaped mass. However, with acute inflammation, the gallbladder is usually too tender to be palpated. Cholecystitis can cause severe right upper quadrant pain that may radiate to the right shoulder, chest, or back; abdominal rigidity and tenderness; fever; pallor; diaphoresis; anorexia; nausea; and vomiting. Recurrent attacks usually occur 1 to 6 hours after meals. Murphy’s sign (inspiratory arrest elicited when the examiner palpates the right upper quadrant as the patient takes a deep breath) is common.

- ***Colon cancer.*** A right lower quadrant mass may occur with cancer of the right colon, which may also cause occult bleeding with anemia and abdominal aching, pressure, or dull cramps. Associated findings include weakness, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, vertigo, and signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction, such as obstipation and vomiting. Occasionally, cancer of the left colon also causes a palpable mass. It usually produces rectal bleeding, intermittent abdominal fullness or cramping, and rectal pressure. The patient may also report fremitus and pelvic discomfort. Later, he develops obstipation; diarrhea; or pencil-shaped, grossly bloody, or mucus-streaked stools. Typically, defecation relieves pain.
  - ***Crohn’s disease.*** With Crohn’s disease, tender, sausage-shaped masses are usually palpable in the right lower quadrant and, at times, in the left lower quadrant. Attacks of colicky right lower quadrant pain and diarrhea are common. Associated signs and symptoms include fever, anorexia, weight loss, hyperactive bowel sounds, nausea, abdominal tenderness with guarding, and perirectal, skin, or vaginal fistulas.
    - ***Diverticulitis.*** Most common in the sigmoid colon, diverticulitis may produce a left lower quadrant mass that’s usually tender, firm, and fixed. It also produces intermittent abdominal pain that’s relieved by defecation or passage of flatus. Other findings may include alternating constipation and diarrhea, nausea, a low-grade fever, and a distended and tympanic abdomen.
      - ***Gastric cancer.*** Advanced gastric cancer may produce an epigastric mass. Early findings include chronic dyspepsia and epigastric discomfort, whereas late findings include weight loss, a feeling of fullness after eating, fatigue and, occasionally, coffee-ground vomitus or melena.
        - ***Hepatomegaly.*** Hepatomegaly produces a firm, blunt, irregular mass in the epigastric region or below the right costal margin. Associated signs and symptoms vary with the causative disorder but commonly include ascites, right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, leg edema, jaundice, palmar erythema, spider angiomas, gynecomastia,

          testicular atrophy and, possibly, splenomegaly.

- ***Hernia.*** The soft and typically tender bulge is usually an effect of prolonged, increased intra-abdominal pressure on weakened areas of the abdominal wall. An umbilical hernia is typically located around the umbilicus and an inguinal hernia in either the right or left groin. An incisional hernia can occur anywhere along a previous incision. Hernia may be the only sign until strangulation occurs.
  - ***Hydronephrosis.*** Enlarging one or both kidneys, hydronephrosis produces a smooth, boggy mass in one or both flanks. Other findings vary with the degree of hydronephrosis. The patient may have severe colicky renal pain or dull flank pain that radiates to the groin, vulva, or testes. Hematuria, pyuria, dysuria, alternating oliguria and polyuria, nocturia, accelerated hypertension, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.
    - ***Ovarian cyst.*** A large ovarian cyst may produce a smooth, rounded, fluctuant mass, resembling a distended bladder, in the suprapubic region. Large or multiple cysts may also cause mild pelvic discomfort, low back pain, menstrual irregularities, and hirsutism. A twisted or ruptured cyst may cause abdominal tenderness, distention, and rigidity.
      - ***Splenomegaly.*** The lymphomas, leukemias, hemolytic anemias, and inflammatory diseases are among the many disorders that may cause splenomegaly. Typically, the smooth edge of the enlarged spleen is palpable in the left upper quadrant. Associated signs and symptoms vary with the causative disorder but usually include a feeling of abdominal fullness, left upper quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness, splenic friction rub, splenic bruits, and a low-grade fever.
        - ***Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids).*** If large enough, these common, benign uterine tumors produce a round, multinodular mass in the suprapubic region. The patient’s chief complaint is usually menorrhagia; she may also experience a feeling of heaviness in the abdomen, and pressure on surrounding organs may cause back pain, constipation, and urinary frequency or urgency. Edema and varicosities of the lower extremities may develop. Rapid fibroid growth in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women needs further evaluation.

**Special Considerations**

Discovery of an abdominal mass commonly causes anxiety. Offer emotional support to the patient and his family as they await the diagnosis. Position the patient comfortably, and administer drugs for pain or anxiety as needed.

If an abdominal mass causes bowel obstruction, watch for indications of peritonitis — abdominal pain and rebound tenderness — and for signs of shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain any diagnostic tests that are needed, and teach the patient about the cause of the abdominal mass once a diagnosis is made. Explain treatment and potential outcomes.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Detecting an abdominal mass in an infant can be quite a challenge. However, these tips will make palpation easier for you: Allow an infant to suck on his bottle or pacifier to prevent crying, which causes abdominal rigidity and interferes with palpation. Avoid tickling him because laughter also causes abdominal rigidity. Also, reduce his apprehension by distracting him with cheerful conversation. Rest your hand on his abdomen for a few moments before palpation. If he remains sensitive, place his hand under yours as you palpate. Consider allowing the child to remain on the parent’s or caregiver’s lap. A gentle rectal examination should also be performed.

In neonates, most abdominal masses result from renal disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease or congenital hydronephrosis. In older infants and children, abdominal masses usually are caused by enlarged organs, such as the liver and spleen.

Other common causes include Wilms’ tumor, neuroblastoma, intussusception, volvulus, Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital megacolon), pyloric stenosis, and abdominal abscess.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Ultrasonography should be used to evaluate a prominent midepigastric mass in thin, elderly patients.

**Abdominal Pain**

**(See Also Abdominal Distention, Abdominal Mass, Abdominal Rigidity)**

Abdominal pain usually results from a GI disorder, but it can be caused by a reproductive, genitourinary (GU), musculoskeletal, or vascular disorder; drug use; or ingestion of toxins. At times, such pain signals life-threatening complications.

Abdominal pain arises from the abdominopelvic viscera, the parietal peritoneum, or the capsules of the liver, kidney, or spleen. It may be acute or chronic and diffuse or localized. Visceral pain develops slowly into a deep, dull, aching pain that’s poorly localized in the epigastric, periumbilical, or lower midabdominal (hypogastric) region. In contrast, somatic (parietal, peritoneal) pain produces a sharp, more intense, and well-localized discomfort that rapidly follows the insult. Movement or coughing aggravates this pain. (See *Abdominal Pain: Types and Locations*.)

**Abdominal Pain: Types and Locations![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.029.png)**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.030.png)

Pain may also be referred to the abdomen from another site with the same or similar nerve supply. This sharp, well-localized, referred pain is felt in skin or deeper tissues and may coexist with skin hyperesthesia and muscle hyperalgesia.

Mechanisms that produce abdominal pain include stretching or tension of the gut wall, traction on the peritoneum or mesentery, vigorous intestinal contraction, inflammation, ischemia, and sensory nerve irritation.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient is experiencing sudden and severe abdominal pain, quickly take his vital signs and palpate pulses below the waist. Be alert for signs of hypovolemic shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension. Obtain I.V. access.*

*Emergency surgery may be required if the patient also has mottled skin*

*below the waist and a pulsating epigastric mass or rebound tenderness and rigidity.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient has no life-threatening signs or symptoms, take his history. Ask him if he has had this type of pain before. Have him describe the pain — for example dull, sharp, stabbing, or burning. Ask if anything relieves the pain or makes it worse. Ask the patient if the pain is constant or intermittent and when the pain began. Constant, steady abdominal pain suggests organ perforation, ischemia, or inflammation or blood in the peritoneal cavity. Intermittent, cramping abdominal pain suggests that the patient may have obstruction of a hollow organ.

If pain is intermittent, find out the duration of a typical episode. In addition, ask the patient where the pain is located and if it radiates to other areas.

Find out if movement, coughing, exertion, vomiting, eating, elimination, or walking worsens or relieves the pain. The patient may report abdominal pain as indigestion or gas pain, so have him describe it in detail.

Ask the patient about substance abuse and any history of vascular, GI, GU, or reproductive disorders. Ask the female patient about the date of her last period, changes in her menstrual pattern, or dyspareunia.

Ask the patient about appetite changes. Ask about the onset and frequency of nausea or vomiting. Find out about increased flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, and changes in stool consistency. When was the last bowel movement? Ask about urinary frequency, urgency, or pain. Is the urine cloudy or pink?

Perform a physical examination. Take the patient’s vital signs, and assess skin turgor and mucous membranes. Inspect his abdomen for distention or visible peristaltic waves and, if indicated, measure his abdominal girth.

Auscultate for bowel sounds, and characterize their motility. Percuss all quadrants, noting the percussion sounds. Palpate the entire abdomen for masses, rigidity, and tenderness. Check for costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness, abdominal tenderness with guarding, and rebound tenderness. (See *Abdominal Pain: Common Causes and Associated Findings*, pages 16 to 19.)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Abdominal aortic aneurysm (dissecting).*** Initially, this life-threatening disorder may produce dull lower abdominal, lower back, or severe chest pain. Usually, abdominal aortic aneurysm produces constant upper abdominal pain, which may worsen when the patient lies down and may abate when he leans forward or sits up. Palpation may reveal an epigastric mass that pulsates before rupture but not after it.

  Other findings may include mottled skin below the waist, absent femoral and pedal pulses, lower blood pressure in the legs than in the arms, mild to moderate abdominal tenderness with guarding, and abdominal rigidity. Signs of shock, such as tachycardia and tachypnea, may appear.

- ***Abdominal cancer.*** Abdominal pain usually occurs late in abdominal cancer. It may be accompanied by anorexia, weight loss, weakness, depression, and abdominal mass and distention.
  - ***Abdominal trauma.*** Generalized or localized abdominal pain occurs with ecchymoses on the abdomen, abdominal tenderness, vomiting and, with hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity, abdominal rigidity. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The patient may have signs of hypovolemic shock, such as hypotension and a rapid, thready pulse.
    - ***Adrenal crisis.*** Severe abdominal pain appears early, along with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, profound weakness, anorexia, and fever. Later signs are progressive loss of consciousness; hypotension; tachycardia; oliguria; cool, clammy skin; and increased motor activity, which may progress to delirium or seizures.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.036.png) ***Anthrax, GI.*** An acute infectious disease, GI anthrax is caused by the gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium *Bacillus anthracis.* Although the disease most commonly occurs in wild and domestic grazing animals, such

as cattle, sheep, and goats, the spores can live in the soil for many years. The disease can occur in humans exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals, or biological warfare. Most natural cases occur in agricultural regions worldwide. Anthrax may occur in any of the following forms: cutaneous, inhaled, or GI.

GI anthrax is caused by eating contaminated meat from an infected animal. Initial signs and symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Late signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, severe bloody diarrhea, and hematemesis.

- ***Appendicitis.*** With appendicitis, a life-threatening disorder, pain initially occurs in the epigastric or umbilical region. Anorexia, nausea, or vomiting may occur after the onset of pain. Pain localizes at McBurney’s point in the right lower quadrant and is accompanied by abdominal rigidity, increasing tenderness (especially over McBurney’s point), rebound tenderness, and retractive respirations. Later signs and symptoms include malaise, constipation (or diarrhea), low-grade fever, and tachycardia.
  - ***Cholecystitis.*** Severe pain in the right upper quadrant may arise suddenly or increase gradually over several hours, usually after meals. It may radiate to the right shoulder, chest, or back. Accompanying the pain are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal rigidity, tenderness, pallor, and diaphoresis. Murphy’s sign (inspiratory arrest elicited when the examiner palpates the right upper quadrant as the patient takes a deep breath) is common.
    - ***Cholelithiasis.*** Patients may suffer sudden, severe, and paroxysmal pain in the right upper quadrant lasting several minutes to several hours. The pain may radiate to the epigastrium, back, or shoulder blades. The pain is accompanied by anorexia, nausea, vomiting (sometimes bilious), diaphoresis, restlessness, and abdominal tenderness with guarding over the gallbladder or biliary duct. The patient may also experience fatty food intolerance and frequent indigestion.
      - ***Cirrhosis.*** Dull abdominal aching occurs early and is usually accompanied by anorexia, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. Subsequent right upper quadrant pain worsens when the patient sits up or leans forward. Associated signs include fever, ascites, leg edema, weight gain, hepatomegaly, jaundice, severe pruritus, bleeding tendencies, palmar erythema, and spider angiomas. Gynecomastia and testicular atrophy may also be present.
        - ***Crohn’s disease.*** An acute attack in Crohn’s disease causes severe cramping pain in the lower abdomen, typically preceded by weeks or months of milder cramping pain. Crohn’s disease may also cause diarrhea, hyperactive bowel sounds, dehydration, weight loss, fever, abdominal tenderness with guarding, and possibly a palpable mass in a lower quadrant. Abdominal pain is commonly relieved by defecation. Milder chronic signs and symptoms include right lower quadrant pain with diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss. Complications include perirectal or vaginal fistulas.
- ***Diverticulitis.*** Mild cases of diverticulitis usually produce intermittent, diffuse left lower quadrant pain, which is sometimes relieved by defecation or passage of flatus and worsened by eating. Other signs and symptoms include nausea, constipation or diarrhea, a low-grade fever and, in many cases, a palpable abdominal mass that’s usually tender, firm, and fixed. Rupture causes severe left lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity and, possibly, signs and symptoms of sepsis and shock (high fever, chills, and hypotension).
  - ***Duodenal ulcer.*** Localized abdominal pain — described as steady, gnawing, burning, aching, or hunger-like — may occur high in the midepigastrium, slightly off center, usually on the right. The pain usually doesn’t radiate unless pancreatic penetration occurs. It typically begins 2 to 4 hours after a meal and may cause nocturnal awakening. Ingestion of food or antacids brings relief until the cycle starts again, but it may also produce weight gain. Other symptoms include changes in bowel habits and heartburn or retrosternal burning.
    - ***Ectopic pregnancy.*** Lower abdominal pain may be sharp, dull, or cramping and constant or intermittent in ectopic pregnancy, a potentially life- threatening disorder. Vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting may occur, along with urinary frequency, a tender adnexal mass, and a 1-to 2-month history of amenorrhea. Rupture of the fallopian tube produces sharp lower abdominal pain, which may radiate to the shoulders and neck and become extreme with cervical or adnexal palpation. Signs of shock (such as pallor, tachycardia, and hypotension) may also appear.
      - ***Endometriosis.*** Constant, severe pain in the lower abdomen usually begins 5 to 7 days before the start of menses and may be aggravated by defecation. Depending on the location of the ectopic tissue, the pain may be accompanied by constipation, abdominal tenderness, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and deep sacral pain.
        - __Escherichia coli *O157:H7.*__ *E. coli* O157:H7 is an aerobic, gram-negative bacillus that causes food-borne illness. Most strains of *E. coli* are harmless and are part of normal intestinal flora of healthy humans and animals. However, *E. coli* O157:H7, one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium, is capable of producing a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. Eating undercooked beef or other foods contaminated with the bacteria causes the disease. Signs and symptoms include watery or bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramps. In children younger than age 5 and in elderly patients, hemolytic-uremic syndrome may develop, and this may ultimately lead to acute renal failure.
- ***Gastric ulcer.*** Diffuse, gnawing, burning pain in the left upper quadrant or epigastric area commonly occurs 1 to 2 hours after meals and may be relieved by ingestion of food or antacids. Vague bloating and nausea after eating are common. Indigestion, weight change, anorexia, and episodes of GI bleeding also occur.
  - ***Gastritis.*** With acute gastritis, the patient experiences a rapid onset of abdominal pain that can range from mild epigastric discomfort to burning pain in the left upper quadrant. Other typical features include belching, fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, bloody or coffee-ground vomitus, and melena. However, significant bleeding is unusual, unless the patient has hemorrhagic gastritis.
    - ***Gastroenteritis.*** Cramping or colicky abdominal pain, which can be diffuse, originates in the left upper quadrant and radiates or migrates to the other quadrants, usually in a peristaltic manner. It’s accompanied by diarrhea, hyperactive bowel sounds, headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting.
      - ***Heart failure.*** Right upper quadrant pain commonly accompanies heart failure’s hallmarks: jugular vein distention, dyspnea, tachycardia, and peripheral edema. Other findings include nausea, vomiting, ascites, productive cough, crackles, cool extremities, and cyanotic nail beds. Clinical signs are numerous and vary according to the stage of the disease and amount of cardiovascular impairment.
        - ***Hepatitis.*** Liver enlargement from any type of hepatitis causes discomfort or dull pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Associated signs and symptoms may include dark urine, clay-colored stools, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, jaundice, malaise, and pruritus.
- ***Intestinal obstruction.*** Short episodes of intense, colicky, cramping pain alternate with pain-free intervals in an intestinal obstruction, a life- threatening disorder. Accompanying signs and symptoms may include abdominal distention, tenderness, and guarding; visible peristaltic waves; high-pitched, tinkling, or hyperactive sounds proximal to the obstruction and hypoactive or absent sounds distally; obstipation; and pain-induced agitation. In jejunal and duodenal obstruction, nausea and bilious vomiting occur early. In distal small-or large-bowel obstruction, nausea and vomiting are commonly feculent. Complete obstruction produces absent bowel sounds. Late-stage obstruction produces signs of hypovolemic shock, such as hypotension and tachycardia.
- ***Irritable bowel syndrome.*** Lower abdominal cramping or pain is aggravated by ingestion of coarse or raw foods and may be alleviated by defecation or passage of flatus. Related findings include abdominal tenderness, diurnal diarrhea alternating with constipation or normal bowel function, and small stools with visible mucus. Dyspepsia, nausea, and abdominal distention with a feeling of incomplete evacuation may also occur. Stress, anxiety, and emotional lability intensify the symptoms.
  - ***Listeriosis.*** A serious infection, listeriosis is caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes.* This food-borne illness primarily affects pregnant women, neonates, and those with weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms include fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the infection spreads to the nervous system, meningitis may develop. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and change in the level of consciousness.

![ref3] **GENDER CUE**

*Listeriosis infection during pregnancy may lead to premature delivery, infection of the neonate, or stillbirth.*

- ***Mesenteric artery ischemia.*** Always suspect mesenteric artery ischemia in patients older than age 50 with chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiovascular infarct, or hypotension who develop sudden, severe abdominal pain after 2 to 3 days of colicky periumbilical pain and diarrhea. Initially, the abdomen is soft and tender with decreased bowel sounds. Associated findings include vomiting, anorexia, alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation and, in late stages, extreme abdominal tenderness with rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, absent bowel sounds, and cool, clammy skin.
  - ***Norovirus.*** The highly contagious *Norovirus* infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. An acute onset of GI irritation, with abdominal pain or cramping, occurs in patients affected with Noroviruses. Other symptoms include vomiting, uncontrolled stool seepage, watery nonbloody diarrhea, and nausea. Less common symptoms include low-grade fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, and generalized fatigue. Typically, *Norovirus*

    symptoms last from 1 to 5 days without lasting effects.

- ***Ovarian cyst.*** Torsion or hemorrhage causes pain and tenderness in the right or left lower quadrant. Sharp and severe if the patient suddenly stands or stoops, the pain becomes brief and intermittent if the torsion self-corrects or dull and diffuse after several hours if it doesn’t. Pain is accompanied by slight fever, mild nausea and vomiting, abdominal tenderness, a palpable abdominal mass and, possibly, amenorrhea. Abdominal distention may occur if the patient has a large cyst. Peritoneal irritation, or rupture and ensuing peritonitis, causes high fever and severe nausea and vomiting.
  - ***Pancreatitis.*** Life-threatening acute pancreatitis produces fulminating, continuous upper abdominal pain that may radiate to both flanks and to the back. To relieve this pain, the patient may bend forward, draw his knees to his chest, or move restlessly about. Early findings include abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, fever, pallor, tachycardia and, in some patients, abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, and hypoactive bowel sounds. Turner’s sign (ecchymosis of the abdomen or flank) or Cullen’s sign (a bluish tinge around the umbilicus) signals hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Jaundice may occur as inflammation subsides. Chronic pancreatitis produces severe left upper quadrant or epigastric pain that radiates to the back. Abdominal tenderness, a midepigastric mass, jaundice, fever, and splenomegaly may occur. Steatorrhea, weight loss, maldigestion, and diabetes mellitus are common.
    - ***Pelvic inflammatory disease.*** Pain in the right or left lower quadrant ranges from vague discomfort worsened by movement to deep, severe, and progressive pain. Sometimes, metrorrhagia precedes or accompanies the onset of pain. Extreme pain accompanies cervical or adnexal palpation. Associated findings include abdominal tenderness, a palpable abdominal or pelvic mass, fever, occasional chills, nausea, vomiting, urinary discomfort, and abnormal vaginal bleeding or purulent vaginal discharge.
      - ***Perforated ulcer.*** With perforated ulcer, a life-threatening disorder, sudden, severe, and prostrating epigastric pain may radiate through the abdomen to the back or right shoulder. Other signs and symptoms include boardlike abdominal rigidity, tenderness with guarding, generalized rebound tenderness, absent bowel sounds, grunting and shallow respirations and, in many cases, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope.
        - ***Peritonitis.*** With peritonitis, a life-threatening disorder, sudden and severe pain can be diffuse or localized in the area of the underlying disorder; movement worsens the pain. The degree of abdominal tenderness usually varies according to the extent of disease. Typical findings include fever; chills; nausea; vomiting; hypoactive or absent bowel sounds; abdominal tenderness, distention, and rigidity; rebound tenderness and guarding; hyperalgesia; tachycardia; hypotension; tachypnea; and positive psoas and obturator signs.
- ***Prostatitis.*** Vague abdominal pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen, groin, perineum, or rectum may develop with prostatitis. Other findings include dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, fever, chills, low back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and nocturia. Scrotal pain, penile pain, and pain on ejaculation may occur in chronic cases.
  - ***Pyelonephritis (acute).*** Progressive lower quadrant pain in one or both sides, flank pain, and CVA tenderness characterize this disorder. Pain may radiate to the lower midabdomen or to the groin. Additional signs and symptoms include abdominal and back tenderness, high fever, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, and urinary frequency and urgency.
    - ***Renal calculi.*** Depending on the location of calculi, severe abdominal or back pain may occur. However, the classic symptom is severe, colicky pain that travels from the CVA to the flank, suprapubic region, and external genitalia. The pain may be excruciating or dull and constant. Pain-induced agitation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, chills, hypertension, and urinary urgency with hematuria and dysuria may occur.
      - ***Sickle cell crisis.*** Sudden, severe abdominal pain may accompany chest, back, hand, or foot pain. Associated signs and symptoms include weakness, aching joints, dyspnea, and scleral jaundice.
        - ***Smallpox (variola major).*** Worldwide eradication of smallpox was achieved in 1977; the United States and Russia have the only known storage sites for the virus. The virus is considered a potential agent for biological warfare. Initial signs and symptoms include high fever, malaise, prostration, severe headache, backache, and abdominal pain. A maculopapular rash develops on the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx, face, and forearms and then spreads to the trunk and legs. Within 2 days, the rash becomes vesicular and later pustular. The lesions develop at the same time, appear identical, and are more prominent on the face and extremities. The pustules are round, firm, and embedded in the skin. After 8 to 9 days, the pustules form a crust, and later, the scab separates from the skin, leaving a pitted scar. In fatal cases, death results from encephalitis, extensive bleeding, or secondary infection.
          - ***Splenic infarction.*** Fulminating pain in the left upper quadrant occurs along with chest pain that may worsen on inspiration. Pain usually radiates to the left shoulder with splinting of the left diaphragm, abdominal guarding and,

            occasionally, a splenic friction rub.

- ***Ulcerative colitis.*** Ulcerative colitis may begin with vague abdominal discomfort that leads to cramping lower abdominal pain. As the disorder progresses, pain may become steady and diffuse, increasing with movement and coughing. The most common symptom — recurrent and possibly severe diarrhea with blood, pus, and mucus — may relieve the pain. The abdomen may feel soft, squashy, and extremely tender. High-pitched, infrequent bowel sounds may accompany nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and mild, intermittent fever.

**Other Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.038.png) ***Drugs.*** Salicylates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commonly cause burning, gnawing pain in the left upper quadrant or epigastric area, along with nausea and vomiting.

**Special Considerations**

Help the patient find a comfortable position to ease his distress. He should lie in a supine position, with his head flat on the table, arms at his sides, and knees slightly flexed to relax the abdominal muscles. Monitor him closely because abdominal pain can signal a life-threatening disorder. Especially important indications include tachycardia, hypotension, clammy skin, abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, a change in the pain’s location or intensity, or sudden relief from the pain.

Withhold analgesics from the patient because they may mask symptoms. Also withhold food and fluids because surgery may be needed. Prepare for I.V. infusion and insertion of a nasogastric or other intestinal tube. Peritoneal lavage or abdominal paracentesis may be required.

You may have to prepare the patient for a diagnostic procedure, which may include a pelvic and rectal examination; blood, urine, and stool tests; X-rays; barium studies; ultrasonography; endoscopy; and biopsy.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the diagnostic tests the patient will need, which foods and fluids he shouldn’t have, the need to report any changes in bowel habits, and how to position himself to alleviate symptoms.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because a child typically has difficulty describing abdominal pain, you should pay close attention to nonverbal cues, such as wincing, lethargy, or unusual positioning (such as a sidelying position with knees flexed to the abdomen). Observing the child while he coughs, walks, or climbs may offer some diagnostic clues. Also, remember that a parent’s description of the child’s complaints is a subjective interpretation of what the parent believes is wrong.

In children, abdominal pain can signal a disorder with greater severity or different associated signs than in adults. Appendicitis, for example, has higher rupture and mortality rates in children, and vomiting may be the only other sign. Acute pyelonephritis may cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, but not the classic urologic signs found in adults. Peptic ulcer, which is becoming increasingly common in teenagers, causes nocturnal pain and colic that, unlike peptic ulcer in adults, may not be relieved by food.

Abdominal pain in children can also result from lactose intolerance, allergic- tension-fatigue syndrome, volvulus, Meckel’s diverticulum, intussusception, mesenteric adenitis, diabetes mellitus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and many uncommon disorders such as heavy metal poisoning. Remember, too, that a child’s complaint of abdominal pain may reflect an emotional need, such as a wish to avoid school or to gain adult attention.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Advanced age may decrease the manifestations of acute abdominal disease. Pain may be less severe, fever less pronounced, and signs of peritoneal inflammation diminished or absent.

**Abdominal Rigidity**

**(See Also Abdominal Distention, Abdominal Mass, Abdominal Pain) [Abdominal muscle spasm,**

**involuntary guarding]**

Detected by palpation, abdominal rigidity refers to abnormal muscle tension or inflexibility of the abdomen. Rigidity may be voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary rigidity reflects the patient’s fear or nervousness upon palpation; involuntary rigidity reflects potentially life-threatening peritoneal irritation or inflammation. (See *Recognizing Voluntary Rigidity*, page 26.)

Involuntary rigidity most commonly results from GI disorders, but may also result from pulmonary and vascular disorders and from the effects of insect toxins. Usually, it’s accompanied by fever; nausea; vomiting; and abdominal tenderness, distention, and pain.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*After palpating abdominal rigidity, quickly take the patient’s vital signs. Even though the patient may not appear gravely ill or have markedly abnormal vital signs, abdominal rigidity calls for emergency interventions.*

*Prepare to administer oxygen and to insert an I.V. line for fluid and blood replacement. The patient may require drugs to support blood pressure. Also prepare him for catheterization, and monitor intake and output.*

*A nasogastric tube may have to be inserted to relieve abdominal distention. Because emergency surgery may be necessary, the patient should be prepared for laboratory tests and X-rays.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s condition allows further assessment, take a brief history. Find out when the abdominal rigidity began. Is it associated with abdominal pain? If so, did the pain begin at the same time? Determine whether the abdominal rigidity is localized or generalized. Is it always present? Has its site changed or remained constant? Next, ask about aggravating or alleviating factors, such as position changes, coughing, vomiting, elimination, and walking.

Explore other signs and symptoms. Inspect the abdomen for peristaltic waves, which may be visible in very thin patients. Also, check for a visibly distended bowel loop. Next, auscultate bowel sounds. Perform light palpation to locate the rigidity and determine its severity. Avoid deep palpation, which may exacerbate abdominal pain. Finally, check for poor skin turgor and dry mucous

membranes, which indicate dehydration.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Abdominal aortic aneurysm (dissecting).*** Mild to moderate abdominal rigidity occurs with abdominal aortic aneurysm, a life-threatening disorder. Typically, it’s accompanied by constant upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the lower back. The pain may worsen when the patient lies down and may be relieved when he leans forward or sits up. Before rupture, the aneurysm may produce a pulsating mass in the epigastrium, accompanied by a systolic bruit over the aorta. However, the mass stops pulsating after rupture. Associated signs and symptoms include mottled skin below the waist, absent femoral and pedal pulses, lower blood pressure in the legs than in the arms, and mild to moderate tenderness with guarding. Significant blood loss causes signs of shock, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and cool, clammy skin.

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Recognizing Voluntary![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.039.png)**

**Rigidity**

Distinguishing voluntary from involuntary abdominal rigidity is a must for accurate assessment. Review this comparison so that you can quickly tell the two apart.

**VOLUNTARY RIGIDITY**

Usually symmetrical

More rigid on inspiration (expiration causes muscle relaxation)

Eased by relaxation techniques, such as positioning the patient comfortably and talking to him in a calm, soothing manner

Painless when the patient sits up using his abdominal muscles alone

**INVOLUNTARY RIGIDITY**

Usually asymmetrical

Equally rigid on inspiration and expiration Unaffected by relaxation techniques

Painful when the patient sits up using his abdominal muscles alone![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.040.png)

- ***Insect toxins.*** Insect stings and bites, especially black widow spider bites, release toxins that can produce generalized, cramping abdominal pain, usually accompanied by rigidity. These toxins may also cause a low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, tremors, and burning sensations in the hands and feet. Some patients develop increased salivation, hypertension, paresis, and hyperactive reflexes. Children commonly are restless, have an expiratory grunt, and keep their legs flexed.
  - ***Mesenteric artery ischemia.*** A life-threatening disorder, mesenteric artery ischemia is characterized by 2 to 3 days of persistent, low-grade abdominal pain and diarrhea leading to sudden, severe abdominal pain and rigidity. Rigidity occurs in the central or periumbilical region and is accompanied by severe abdominal tenderness, fever, and signs of shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension. Other findings may include vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea or constipation. Always suspect this disorder in patients older than age 50 who have a history of heart failure, arrhythmia, cardiovascular infarct, or hypotension.
    - ***Peritonitis.*** Depending on the cause of peritonitis, abdominal rigidity may be localized or generalized. For example, if an inflamed appendix causes local peritonitis, rigidity may be localized in the right lower quadrant. If a perforated ulcer causes widespread peritonitis, rigidity may be generalized and, in severe cases, boardlike.

      Peritonitis also causes sudden and severe abdominal pain that can be localized or generalized. In addition, it can produce abdominal tenderness and distention, rebound tenderness, guarding, hyperalgesia, hypoactive or absent bowel sounds, nausea, and vomiting. Usually, the patient also displays fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.

**Special Considerations**

Continue to monitor the patient closely for signs of shock. Position him as comfortably as possible. The patient should lie in a supine position, with his head flat on the table, arms at his sides, and knees slightly flexed to relax the abdominal muscles. Because analgesics may mask symptoms, withhold them until a tentative diagnosis has been made. Because emergency surgery may be required, withhold food and fluids and administer an I.V. antibiotic. Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, which may include blood, urine, and stool studies; chest and abdominal X-rays; a computed tomography scan; magnetic resonance imaging; peritoneal lavage; and gastroscopy or colonoscopy. A pelvic or rectal examination may also be done.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain diagnostic tests or surgery the patient will need, and give him instruction on measures to reduce anxiety.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Voluntary rigidity may be difficult to distinguish from involuntary rigidity if associated pain makes the child restless, tense, or apprehensive. However, in any child with suspected involuntary rigidity, your priority is early detection of dehydration and shock, which can rapidly become life threatening.

Abdominal rigidity in the child can stem from gastric perforation, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, duodenal obstruction, meconium ileus, intussusception, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, and appendicitis.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Advanced age and impaired cognition decrease pain perception and intensity. Weakening of abdominal muscles may decrease muscle spasms and rigidity.

**Accessory Muscle Use**

When breathing requires extra effort, the accessory muscles — the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, pectoralis major, trapezius, internal intercostals, and abdominal muscles — stabilize the thorax during respiration. Some accessory muscle use normally takes place during such activities as singing, talking, coughing, defecating, and exercising. (See *Accessory Muscles: Locations and Functions*, page 28.) However, more pronounced use of these muscles may signal acute respiratory distress, diaphragmatic weakness, or fatigue. It may also result from chronic respiratory disease. Typically, the extent

of accessory muscle use reflects the severity of the underlying cause.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient displays increased accessory muscle use, immediately look for signs of acute respiratory distress. These include a decreased level of consciousness, shortness of breath when speaking, tachypnea, intercostal and sternal retractions, cyanosis, adventitious breath sounds (such as wheezing or stridor), diaphoresis, nasal flaring, and extreme apprehension or agitation. Quickly auscultate for abnormal, diminished, or absent breath sounds. Check for airway obstruction, and, if detected, attempt to restore airway patency. Insert an airway, or intubate the patient. Then, begin suctioning and manual or mechanical ventilation. Assess oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry, if available. Administer oxygen; if the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), use only a low flow rate for mild COPD exacerbations. You may need to use a high flow rate initially, but be attentive to the patient’s respiratory drive. Giving a patient with COPD too much oxygen may decrease his respiratory drive. An I.V. line may be required.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s condition allows, examine him more closely. Ask him about the onset, duration, and severity of associated signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or fever.

Explore his medical history, focusing on respiratory disorders, such as infection or COPD. Ask about cardiac disorders, such as heart failure, which may lead to pulmonary edema; also, inquire about neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which may affect respiratory muscle function. Note a history of allergies or asthma. Because collagen vascular diseases can cause diffuse infiltrative lung disease, ask about such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.

**Accessory Muscles: Locations and Functions![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.041.png)**

Physical exertion and pulmonary disease usually increase the work of breathing, taxing the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. When this happens, accessory muscles provide the extra effort needed to maintain respirations.![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.042.png) The upper accessory muscles assist with inspiration, whereas the upper chest, sternum, internal intercostal, and abdominal muscles assist with expiration.

With inspiration, the scalene muscles elevate, fix, and expand the upper chest. The sternocleidomastoid muscles raise the sternum, expanding the chest’s anteroposterior and longitudinal dimensions. The pectoralis major elevates the chest, increasing its anteroposterior size, and the trapezius raises the thoracic cage.

With expiration, the internal intercostals depress the ribs, decreasing the chest size. The abdominal muscles pull the lower chest down, depress the lower ribs, and compress the abdominal contents, which exerts pressure on the chest.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.043.png)

Ask about recent trauma, especially to the spine or chest. Find out if the patient has recently undergone pulmonary function tests or received respiratory therapy. Ask about smoking and occupational exposure to chemical fumes or mineral dusts such as asbestos. Explore the family history for such disorders as cystic fibrosis and neurofibromatosis, which can cause diffuse infiltrative lung disease.

Perform a detailed chest examination, noting an abnormal respiratory rate, pattern, or depth. Assess the color, temperature, and turgor of the patient’s skin, and check for clubbing.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).*** In ARDS, a life-threatening disorder, accessory muscle use increases in response to hypoxia. It’s accompanied by intercostal, supracostal, and sternal retractions on inspiration and by grunting on expiration. Other characteristics include tachypnea, dyspnea, diaphoresis, diffuse crackles, and a cough with pink, frothy sputum. Worsening hypoxia produces anxiety, tachycardia, and mental sluggishness.
  - ***Airway obstruction.*** Acute upper airway obstruction can be life threatening
    - fortunately, most obstructions are subacute or chronic. Typically, this disorder increases accessory muscle use. Its most telling sign, however, is inspiratory stridor. Associated signs and symptoms include dyspnea, tachypnea, gasping, wheezing, coughing, drooling, intercostal retractions, cyanosis, and tachycardia.
    - ***Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.*** Typically, this progressive motor neuron disorder affects the diaphragm more than the accessory muscles. As a result, increased accessory muscle use is characteristic. Other signs and symptoms include fasciculations, muscle atrophy and weakness, spasticity, bilateral Babinski’s reflex, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. Incoordination makes carrying out routine activities difficult for the patient. Associated signs and symptoms include impaired speech, difficulty chewing or swallowing and breathing, urinary frequency and urgency and, occasionally, choking and excessive drooling. (*Note:* Other neuromuscular disorders may produce similar signs and symptoms.) Although the patient’s mental status remains intact, his poor prognosis may cause periodic depression.
- ***Asthma.*** During acute asthma attacks, the patient usually displays increased accessory muscle use. Accompanying it are severe dyspnea, tachypnea, wheezing, a productive cough, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Auscultation reveals faint or possibly absent breath sounds, musical crackles, and rhonchi. Other signs and symptoms include tachycardia, diaphoresis, and apprehension caused by air hunger. Chronic asthma may also cause barrel chest.
  - ***Chronic bronchitis.*** With chronic bronchitis, a form of COPD, increased accessory muscle use may be chronic and is preceded by a productive cough and exertional dyspnea. Chronic bronchitis is accompanied by wheezing, basal crackles, tachypnea, jugular vein distention, prolonged expiration, barrel chest, and clubbing. Cyanosis and weight gain from edema account for the characteristic label of “blue bloater.” A low-grade

fever may occur with secondary infection.

- ***Emphysema.*** Increased accessory muscle use occurs with progressive exertional dyspnea and a minimally productive cough in this form of COPD. Sometimes called a *pink puffer,* the patient will display pursed-lip breathing and tachypnea. Associated signs and symptoms include peripheral cyanosis, anorexia, weight loss, malaise, barrel chest, and clubbing. Auscultation reveals distant heart sounds; percussion detects hyperresonance.
  - ***Pneumonia.*** Bacterial pneumonia usually produces increased accessory muscle use. Initially, this infection produces a sudden high fever with chills. Its associated signs and symptoms include chest pain, a productive cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, expiratory grunting, cyanosis, diaphoresis, and fine crackles.
    - ***Pulmonary edema.*** With acute pulmonary edema, increased accessory muscle use is accompanied by dyspnea, tachypnea, orthopnea, crepitant crackles, wheezing, and a cough with pink, frothy sputum. Other findings include restlessness, tachycardia, ventricular gallop, and cool, clammy, cyanotic skin.
      - ***Pulmonary embolism.*** Although signs and symptoms vary with the size, number, and location of the emboli, pulmonary embolism is a life- threatening disorder that may cause increased accessory muscle use. Typically, it produces dyspnea and tachypnea that may be accompanied by pleuritic or substernal chest pain. Other signs and symptoms include restlessness, anxiety, tachycardia, a productive cough, a low-grade fever and, with a large embolus, hemoptysis, cyanosis, syncope, jugular vein distention, scattered crackles, and focal wheezing.
        - ***Spinal cord injury.*** Increased accessory muscle use may occur, depending on the location and severity of the injury. An injury below L1 typically doesn’t affect the diaphragm or accessory muscles, whereas an injury between C3 and C5 affects the upper respiratory muscles and diaphragm, causing increased accessory muscle use. Associated signs and symptoms of spinal cord injury include unilateral or bilateral Babinski’s reflex, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, spasticity, and variable or total loss of pain and temperature sensation, proprioception, and motor function. Horner’s syndrome (unilateral ptosis, pupillary constriction, facial anhidrosis) may occur with lower cervical cord injury.
          - ***Thoracic injury.*** Increased accessory muscle use may occur, depending on the type and extent of injury. Associated signs and symptoms of this potentially life-threatening injury include an obvious chest wound or

bruising, chest pain, dyspnea, cyanosis, and agitation. Signs of shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension, occur with significant blood loss.

**Other Causes**

- ***Diagnostic tests and treatments.*** Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), incentive spirometry, and intermittent positive-pressure breathing can increase accessory muscle use.

**Special Considerations**

If the patient is alert, elevate the head of the bed to make his breathing as easy as possible. Encourage him to get plenty of rest and to drink plenty of fluids to liquefy secretions. Administer oxygen. Prepare him for such tests as PFTs, chest X-rays, lung scans, arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count, and sputum culture.

If appropriate, stress how smoking endangers the patient’s health, and refer him to an organized program to stop smoking. Also, teach him how to prevent infection. Explain the purpose of prescribed drugs, such as bronchodilators and mucolytics, and make sure he knows their dosage and schedule.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient relaxation techniques to reduce his apprehension, pursed-lip, diaphragmatic breathing to ease the work of breathing (for patients with chronic lung disorders) and coughing and deep breathing exercises to keep airways clear. Explain measures to prevent infection and how to take prescribed drugs, and provide resources for quitting smoking.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because an infant or child tires sooner than an adult, respiratory distress can more rapidly precipitate respiratory failure. Upper airway obstruction — caused by edema, bronchospasm, or a foreign object — usually produces respiratory distress and increased accessory muscle use. Disorders associated with airway obstruction include acute epiglottiditis, croup, pertussis, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. Supraventricular, intercostal, or abdominal retractions indicate accessory muscle use.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Because of age-related loss of elasticity in the rib cage, accessory muscle use may be part of the older person’s normal breathing pattern.

**Agitation**

**(See Also Anxiety)**

Agitation refers to a state of hyperarousal, increased tension, and irritability that can lead to confusion, hyperactivity, and overt hostility. Agitation can result from a toxic (poisons), metabolic, or infectious cause; brain injury; or a psychiatric disorder. It can also result from pain, fever, anxiety, drug use and withdrawal, hypersensitivity reactions, and various disorders. It can arise gradually or suddenly and last for minutes or months. Whether it’s mild or severe, agitation worsens with increased fever, pain, stress, or external stimuli.

Agitation alone merely signals a change in the patient’s condition. However, it’s a useful indicator of a developing disorder. Obtaining a good history is critical to determining the underlying cause of agitation.

**History and Physical Examination**

Determine the severity of the patient’s agitation by examining the number and quality of agitation-induced behaviors, such as emotional lability, confusion, memory loss, hyperactivity, and hostility. Obtain a history from the patient or a family member, including diet, known allergies, and use of herbal medicine.

Ask if the patient is being treated for any illnesses. Has he had any recent infections, trauma, stress, or changes in sleep patterns? Ask the patient about prescribed or over-the-counter drug use, including supplements and herbal medicines. Check for signs of drug abuse, such as needle tracks and dilated pupils. Ask about alcohol intake. Obtain the patient’s baseline vital signs and neurologic status for future comparison.

**Medical Causes**


- ***Alcohol withdrawal syndrome.*** Mild to severe agitation occurs in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, along with hyperactivity, tremors, and anxiety. With delirium, the potentially life-threatening stage of alcohol withdrawal, severe agitation accompanies hallucinations, insomnia, diaphoresis, and a depressed mood. The patient’s pulse rate and temperature rise as withdrawal progresses; status epilepticus, cardiac exhaustion, and shock can occur.
  - ***Anxiety.*** Anxiety produces varying degrees of agitation. The patient may be unaware of his anxiety or may complain of it without knowing its cause. Other findings include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cool and clammy skin, frontal headache, back pain, insomnia, depression, and tremors.
    - ***Dementia.*** Mild to severe agitation can result from many common syndromes, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases. The patient may display a decrease in memory, attention span, problem-solving ability, and alertness. Hypoactivity, wandering behavior, hallucinations, aphasia, and insomnia may also occur.
      - ***Drug withdrawal syndrome.*** Mild to severe agitation occurs in drug withdrawal syndrome. Related findings vary with the drug, but include anxiety, abdominal cramps, diaphoresis, and anorexia. With opioid or barbiturate withdrawal, a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), seizures, and elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate can also occur.
        - ***Hepatic encephalopathy.*** Agitation occurs only with fulminating encephalopathy. Other findings include drowsiness, stupor, fetor hepaticus, asterixis, and hyperreflexia.
          - ***Hypersensitivity reaction.*** Moderate to severe agitation appears, possibly as the first sign of a reaction. Depending on the severity of the reaction, agitation may be accompanied by urticaria, pruritus, and facial and dependent edema. With anaphylactic shock, a potentially life-threatening reaction, agitation occurs rapidly along with apprehension, urticaria or diffuse erythema, warm and moist skin, paresthesia, pruritus, edema, dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypotension, and tachycardia. Abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur.
            - ***Hypoxemia.*** Beginning as restlessness, agitation rapidly worsens. The patient may be confused and have impaired judgment and motor coordination. He may also have headaches, tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, and cyanosis.
              - ***Increased intracranial pressure (ICP).*** Agitation usually precedes other early signs and symptoms, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increased ICP produces respiratory changes, such as Cheyne-Stokes, cluster, ataxic, or apneustic breathing; sluggish, nonreactive, or unequal pupils; widening pulse pressure; tachycardia; a decreased LOC; seizures; and motor changes such as decerebrate or decorticate posture.
- ***Post-head trauma syndrome.*** Shortly after, or even years after injury, mild to severe agitation develops, characterized by disorientation, loss of concentration, angry outbursts, and emotional lability. Other findings include fatigue, wandering behavior, and poor judgment.
  - ***Vitamin B6 deficiency.*** Agitation can range from mild to severe. Other

    effects include seizures, peripheral paresthesia, and dermatitis. Oculogyric crisis may also occur.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Mild to moderate agitation, which is commonly dose related, develops as an adverse reaction to central nervous system stimulants — especially appetite suppressants, such as amphetamines and amphetamine- like drugs, and sympathomimetics, such as ephedrine, caffeine, and theophylline.
  - ***Radiographic contrast media.*** Reaction to the contrast medium injected during various diagnostic tests produces moderate to severe agitation along with other signs of hypersensitivity.

**Special Considerations**

Because agitation can be an early sign of many different disorders, continue to monitor the patient’s vital signs and neurologic status while the cause is being determined. Eliminate stressors, which can increase agitation. Provide adequate lighting, maintain a calm environment, and allow the patient ample time to sleep. Ensure a balanced diet, and provide vitamin supplements and hydration.

Remain calm, nonjudgmental, and nonargumentative. Use restraints sparingly because they tend to increase agitation. If appropriate, prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as a computed tomography scan, skull X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood studies.

**Patient Counseling**

Reassure the patient, and orient him to the procedures and routines of the unit. Provide emotional support and a quiet environment. Explain stress reduction

measures.

**Pediatric Pointers**

A common sign in children, agitation accompanies the expected childhood diseases as well as more severe disorders that can lead to brain damage: hyperbilirubinemia, phenylketonuria, vitamin A deficiency, hepatitis, frontal lobe syndrome, increased ICP, and lead poisoning. In neonates, agitation can stem from alcohol or drug withdrawal if the mother abused these substances.

When evaluating an agitated child, remember to use words that he can understand and to look for nonverbal clues. For instance, if you suspect that pain is causing agitation, ask him to tell you where it hurts, but make sure to watch for other indicators, such as wincing, crying, or moving away.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Any deviation from an older person’s usual activities or rituals may provoke anxiety or agitation. Any environmental change, such as a transfer to a nursing home or a visit from a stranger in the patient’s home, may trigger a need for treatment.

**Amenorrhea**

The absence of menstrual flow, amenorrhea can be classified as primary or secondary. With primary amenorrhea, menstruation fails to begin before age 16. With secondary amenorrhea, it begins at an appropriate age, but later ceases for 3 or more months in the absence of normal physiologic causes, such as pregnancy, lactation, or menopause.

Pathologic amenorrhea results from anovulation or physical obstruction to menstrual outflow, such as from an imperforate hymen, cervical stenosis, or intrauterine adhesions. Anovulation itself may result from hormonal imbalance, debilitating disease, stress or emotional disturbances, strenuous exercise, malnutrition, obesity, or anatomic abnormalities, such as a congenital absence of the ovaries or uterus. Amenorrhea may also result from drug or hormonal

treatments. (See *Understanding Disruptions in Menstruation*, pages 36 and 37.)

**Understanding Disruptions in Menstruation![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.044.png)**

A disruption at any point in the menstrual cycle can produce amenorrhea, as illustrated in the flowchart below.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.045.jpeg)

**History and Physical Examination**

Begin by determining whether the amenorrhea is primary or secondary. If it’s primary, ask the patient at what age her mother first menstruated because age of menarche is fairly consistent in families. Form an overall impression of the patient’s physical, mental, and emotional development because these factors as well as heredity and climate may delay menarche until after age 16.

If menstruation began at an appropriate age but has since ceased, determine

the frequency and duration of the patient’s previous menses. Ask her about the onset and nature of any changes in her normal menstrual pattern, and determine the date of her last period. Find out if she has noticed any related signs, such as breast swelling or weight changes.

Determine when the patient last had a physical examination. Review her health history, noting especially any long-term illnesses, such as anemia, or use of hormonal contraceptives. Ask about exercise habits, especially running, and whether she experiences stress on the job or at home. Probe the patient’s eating habits, including the number and size of daily meals and snacks, and ask if she has gained weight recently.

Observe her appearance for secondary sex characteristics or signs of virilization. If you’re responsible for performing a pelvic examination, check for anatomic aberrations of the outflow tract, such as cervical adhesions, fibroids, or an imperforate hymen.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Adrenal tumor.*** Amenorrhea may be accompanied by acne, thinning scalp hair, hirsutism, increased blood pressure, truncal obesity, and psychotic changes. Asymmetrical ovarian enlargement in conjunction with the rapid onset of virilizing signs is usually indicative of an adrenal tumor.
  - ***Adrenocortical hyperplasia.*** Amenorrhea precedes characteristic cushingoid signs, such as truncal obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, bruises, purple striae, hypertension, renal calculi, psychiatric disturbances, and widened pulse pressure. Acne, thinning scalp hair, and hirsutism typically appear.
    - ***Adrenocortical hypofunction.*** In addition to amenorrhea, adrenocortical hypofunction may cause fatigue, irritability, weight loss, increased pigmentation (including bluish black discoloration of the areolas and mucous membranes of the lips, mouth, rectum, and vagina), vitiligo, nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension.
      - ***Amenorrhea-lactation disorders.*** Amenorrhea-lactation disorders, such as Forbes-Albright and Chiari-Frommel syndromes, produce secondary amenorrhea accompanied by lactation in the absence of breast-feeding. Associated features include hot flashes, dyspareunia, vaginal atrophy, and large, engorged breasts.
        - ***Anorexia nervosa.*** Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder that can cause either primary or secondary amenorrhea. Related findings include significant weight loss, a thin or emaciated appearance, compulsive behavior patterns, a blotchy or sallow complexion, constipation, reduced libido, decreased pleasure in once-enjoyable activities, dry skin, loss of scalp hair, lanugo on the face and arms, skeletal muscle atrophy, and sleep disturbances.
- ***Congenital absence of the ovaries.*** Congenital absence of the ovaries results in primary amenorrhea and the absence of secondary sex characteristics.
  - ***Congenital absence of the uterus.*** Primary amenorrhea occurs with congenital absence of the uterus. The patient may develop breasts.
    - ***Corpus luteum cysts.*** Corpus luteum cysts may cause sudden amenorrhea as well as acute abdominal pain and breast swelling. Examination may reveal a tender adnexal mass and vaginal and cervical hyperemia.
      - ***Hypothalamic tumor.*** In addition to amenorrhea, a hypothalamic tumor can cause endocrine and visual field defects, gonadal underdevelopment or dysfunction, and short stature.
        - ***Hypothyroidism.*** Deficient thyroid hormone levels can cause primary or secondary amenorrhea. Typically vague, early findings include fatigue, forgetfulness, cold intolerance, unexplained weight gain, and constipation. Subsequent signs include bradycardia; decreased mental acuity; dry, flaky, inelastic skin; puffy face, hands, and feet; hoarseness; periorbital edema; ptosis; dry, sparse hair; and thick, brittle nails. Other common findings include anorexia, abdominal distention, decreased libido, ataxia, intention tremor, nystagmus, and delayed reflex relaxation time, especially in the Achilles tendon.
          - ***Mosaicism.*** Mosaicism results in primary amenorrhea and the absence of secondary sex characteristics.
            - ***Ovarian insensitivity to gonadotropins.*** A hormonal disturbance, ovarian insensitivity to gonadotropins leads to amenorrhea and an absence of secondary sex characteristics.
- ***Pituitary tumor.*** Amenorrhea may be the first sign of a pituitary tumor. Associated findings include headache; visual disturbances, such as bitemporal hemianopsia; and acromegaly. Cushingoid signs include moon face, buffalo hump, hirsutism, hypertension, truncal obesity, bruises, purple striae, widened pulse pressure, and psychiatric disturbances.
  - ***Polycystic ovary syndrome.*** Typically, menarche occurs at a normal age, followed by irregular menstrual cycles, oligomenorrhea, and secondary amenorrhea. Or periods of profuse bleeding may alternate with periods of amenorrhea. Obesity, hirsutism, slight deepening of the voice, and enlarged, “oyster-like” ovaries may also accompany this disorder.
- ***Pseudoamenorrhea.*** An anatomic anomaly, such as imperforate hymen, obstructs menstrual flow, causing primary amenorrhea and, possibly, cyclic episodes of abdominal pain. Examination may reveal a pink or blue bulging hymen.
  - ***Pseudocyesis.*** With pseudocyesis, amenorrhea may be accompanied by lordosis, abdominal distention, nausea, and breast enlargement.
    - ***Testicular feminization.*** Primary amenorrhea may signal this form of male pseudohermaphroditism. The patient, outwardly female but genetically male, shows breast and external genital development but scant or absent pubic hair.
      - ***Thyrotoxicosis.*** Thyroid hormone overproduction may result in amenorrhea. Classic signs and symptoms include an enlarged thyroid (goiter), nervousness, heat intolerance, diaphoresis, tremors, palpitations, tachycardia, dyspnea, weakness, and weight loss despite increased appetite.
        - ***Turner’s syndrome.*** Primary amenorrhea and failure to develop secondary sex characteristics may signal this syndrome of genetic ovarian dysgenesis. Typical features include short stature, webbing of the neck, low nuchal hairline, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples and poor breast development, underdeveloped genitalia, and edema of the legs and feet.
          - ***Uterine hypoplasia.*** Primary amenorrhea results from underdevelopment of the uterus, which is detectable on physical examination.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Busulfan, chlorambucil, injectable or implanted contraceptives, cyclophosphamide, and phenothiazines may cause amenorrhea. Hormonal contraceptives may cause anovulation and amenorrhea after they’re discontinued.
  - ***Radiation therapy.*** Irradiation of the abdomen may destroy the endometrium or ovaries, causing amenorrhea.
    - ***Surgery.*** Surgical removal of both ovaries or the uterus produces amenorrhea.

**Special Considerations**

In patients with secondary amenorrhea, physical and pelvic examinations must rule out pregnancy before diagnostic testing begins. Typical tests include progestin withdrawal, serum hormone and thyroid function studies, and endometrial biopsy.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the treatment and expected outcomes, encourage the patient to discuss her fears, and refer her for psychological counseling if needed.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Adolescent girls are especially prone to amenorrhea caused by emotional upsets, typically stemming from school, social, or family problems.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In women older than age 50, amenorrhea usually represents the onset of menopause.

**Amnesia**

Amnesia — a disturbance in, or loss of, memory — may be classified as partial or complete and as anterograde or retrograde. Anterograde amnesia denotes memory loss of events that occurred after the onset of the causative trauma or disease; retrograde amnesia, memory loss of events that occurred before the onset. Depending on the cause, amnesia may arise suddenly or slowly and may be temporary or permanent.

Organic (or true) amnesia results from temporal lobe dysfunction, and it characteristically spares patches of memory. A common symptom in patients with seizures or head trauma, organic amnesia can also be an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease. Hysterical amnesia has a psychogenic origin and characteristically causes complete memory loss. Treatment-induced amnesia is usually transient.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.047.png)

**History and Physical Examination**

Because the patient typically isn’t aware of his amnesia, you’ll usually need help in gathering information from his family or friends. Throughout your assessment, notice the patient’s general appearance, behavior, mood, and train of thought. Ask when the amnesia first appeared and what types of things the patient is unable to remember. Can he learn new information? How long does he remember it? Does the amnesia encompass a recent or remote period?

Test the patient’s recent memory by asking him to identify and repeat three items. Retest after 3 minutes. Test his intermediate memory by asking, “Who was the president before this one?” and “What was the last type of car you bought?” Test remote memory with such questions as “How old are you?” and “Where were you born?”

Take the patient’s vital signs and assess his level of consciousness (LOC). Check his pupils: They should be equal in size and should constrict quickly when exposed to direct light. Also, assess his extraocular movements. Test motor function by having the patient move his arms and legs through their range of motion. Evaluate sensory function with pinpricks on the patient’s skin. (See *Amnesia: Common Causes and Associated Findings*.)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Alzheimer’s disease.*** Alzheimer’s disease usually begins with retrograde amnesia, which progresses slowly over many months or years to include anterograde amnesia, producing severe and permanent memory loss. Associated findings include agitation, inability to concentrate, disregard for personal hygiene, confusion, irritability, and emotional lability. Later signs include aphasia, dementia, incontinence, and muscle rigidity.
  - ***Cerebral hypoxia.*** After recovery from hypoxia (brought on by such conditions as carbon monoxide poisoning or acute respiratory failure), the patient may experience total amnesia for the event, along with sensory disturbances, such as numbness and tingling.
    - ***Head trauma.*** Depending on the trauma’s severity, amnesia may last for minutes, hours, or longer. Usually, the patient experiences brief retrograde and longer anterograde amnesia as well as persistent amnesia about the traumatic event. Severe head trauma can cause permanent amnesia or difficulty retaining recent memories. Related findings may include altered respirations and LOC; headache; dizziness; confusion; visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision; and motor and sensory disturbances, such as hemiparesis and paresthesia, on the side of the body opposite the injury.
      - ***Herpes simplex encephalitis.*** Recovery from herpes simplex encephalitis commonly leaves the patient with severe and possibly permanent amnesia. Associated findings include signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation, such as headache, fever, and altered LOC, along with seizures and various motor and sensory disturbances (such as paresis, numbness, and tingling).
        - ***Hysteria.*** Hysterical amnesia, a complete and long-lasting memory loss, begins and ends abruptly and is typically accompanied by confusion.
- ***Seizures.*** In temporal lobe seizures, amnesia occurs suddenly and lasts for several seconds to minutes. The patient may recall an aura or nothing at all. An irritable focus on the left side of the brain primarily causes amnesia for verbal memories, whereas an irritable focus on the right side of the brain causes graphic and nonverbal amnesia. Associated signs and symptoms may include decreased LOC during the seizure, confusion, abnormal mouth movements, and visual, olfactory, and auditory hallucinations.
  - ***Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.*** Retrograde and anterograde amnesia can become permanent without treatment in this syndrome. Accompanying signs and symptoms include apathy, an inability to concentrate or to put events into sequence, and confabulation to fill memory gaps. The syndrome may also cause diplopia, decreased LOC, headache, ataxia, and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as numbness and tingling.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Anterograde amnesia can be precipitated by general anesthetics, especially fentanyl, halothane, and isoflurane; barbiturates, most commonly pentobarbital and thiopental; and certain benzodiazepines, especially triazolam.
  - ***Electroconvulsive therapy.*** The sudden onset of retrograde or anterograde amnesia occurs with electroconvulsive therapy. Typically, the amnesia lasts for several minutes to several hours, but severe, prolonged amnesia occurs with treatments given frequently over a prolonged period.
    - ***Temporal lobe surgery.*** Usually performed on only one lobe, this surgery causes brief, slight amnesia. However, removal of both lobes results in permanent amnesia.

**Special Considerations**

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, or cerebral angiography.

Provide reality orientation for the patient with retrograde amnesia, and encourage his family to help by supplying familiar photos, objects, and music.

Adjust your patient teaching techniques for the patient with anterograde amnesia because he can’t acquire new information. Include his family in teaching sessions. In addition, write down all instructions — particularly medication dosages and schedules — so the patient won’t have to rely on his memory.

If the patient has severe amnesia, consider basic needs, such as safety, elimination, and nutrition. If necessary, arrange for placement in an extended- care facility.

**Patient Counseling**

Adjust your patient counseling techniques for the patient with anterograde amnesia because he can’t acquire new information. Supply the patient with familiar items, such as music and photos, to help him become oriented. Write out patient medication schedules to avoid depending on memory.

**Pediatric Pointers**

A child who suffers from amnesia during seizures may be mistakenly labeled as “learning disabled.” To prevent this mislabeling, stress the importance of adhering to the prescribed drug schedule, and discuss ways that the child, his parents, and his teachers can cope with amnesia.

**Analgesia**

**(See Also Abdominal)**

Analgesia, the absence of sensitivity to pain, is an important sign of central nervous system disease, commonly indicating a specific type and location of spinal cord lesion. It always occurs with loss of temperature sensation (thermanesthesia) because these sensory nerve impulses travel together in the spinal cord. It can also occur with other sensory deficits — such as paresthesia, loss of proprioception and vibratory sense, and tactile anesthesia — in various disorders involving the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain. However, when accompanied only by thermanesthesia, analgesia points to an incomplete lesion of the spinal cord.

Analgesia can be classified as partial or total below the level of the lesion and as unilateral or bilateral, depending on the cause and level of the lesion. Its onset may be slow and progressive with a tumor or abrupt with trauma. Transient in many cases, analgesia may resolve spontaneously.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Suspect spinal cord injury if the patient complains of unilateral or bilateral analgesia over a large body area, accompanied by paralysis. Immobilize his spine in proper alignment, using a cervical collar and a long backboard, if possible. If a collar or backboard isn’t available, position the* *patient in a supine position on a flat surface and place sandbags around his head, neck, and torso. Use correct technique and extreme caution when moving him to prevent exacerbating spinal injury. Continuously monitor respiratory rate and rhythm, and observe him for accessory muscle use because a complete lesion above the T6 level may cause diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle paralysis. Have an artificial airway and a handheld resuscitation bag on hand, and be prepared to initiate emergency resuscitation measures in case of respiratory failure.*

**History and Physical Examination**

After you’re satisfied that the patient’s spine and respiratory status are stabilized

- or if the analgesia isn’t severe and isn’t accompanied by signs of spinal cord injury — perform a physical examination and baseline neurologic evaluation. First, take the patient’s vital signs and assess his level of consciousness. Then, test pupillary, corneal, cough, and gag reflexes to rule out brain stem and cranial nerve involvement. If the patient is conscious, evaluate his speech, gag reflex, and ability to swallow.

  If possible, observe the patient’s gait and posture, and assess his balance and coordination. Evaluate muscle tone and strength in all extremities. Test for other sensory deficits over all dermatomes (individual skin segments innervated by a specific spinal nerve) by applying light tactile stimulation with a tongue depressor or cotton swab. Perform a more thorough check of pain sensitivity, if necessary, using a pin. (See *Testing for Analgesia*, pages 42 and 43.) Also, test temperature sensation over all dermatomes, using two test tubes — one filled with hot water and the other with cold water. In each arm and leg, test vibration sense (using a tuning fork), proprioception, and superficial and deep tendon reflexes. Check for increased muscle tone by extending and flexing the patient’s elbows and knees as he tries to relax.

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Testing for Analgesia![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.048.png)**

By carefully and systematically testing the patient’s sensitivity to pain, you can determine whether his nerve damage has a segmental or peripheral distribution and help locate the causative lesion.

Tell the patient to relax, and explain that you’re going to lightly touch areas of his skin with a small pin. Have him close his eyes. Apply the pin firmly enough to produce pain without breaking the skin. (Practice on yourself first to learn![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.049.png) how to apply the correct pressure.)

Starting with the patient’s head and face, move down his body, pricking his skin on alternating sides. Have the patient report when he feels pain. Use the blunt end of the pin occasionally, and vary your test pattern to gauge the accuracy of his response.

Document your findings thoroughly, clearly marking areas of lost pain sensation either on a dermatome chart (shown at left) or on appropriate peripheral nerve diagrams (shown below).

**Eccrine Dysfunction in Anhidrosis![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.054.png)**

Eccrine glands, located over most of the skin, help regulate body temperature by secreting sweat. Any change or dysfunction in these glands can result in anhidrosis of varying severity. These illustrations show a normal eccrine gland and some common abnormalities.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.055.png)

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.056.png)

Focus your history taking on the onset of analgesia (sudden or gradual) and on any recent trauma — a fall, sports injury, or automobile accident. Obtain a complete medical history, noting especially any incidence of cancer in the patient or his family.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Anterior cord syndrome.*** With anterior cord syndrome, analgesia and thermanesthesia occur bilaterally below the level of the lesion, along with flaccid paralysis and hypoactive deep tendon reflexes.
  - ***Central cord syndrome.*** Typically, analgesia and thermanesthesia occur bilaterally in several dermatomes, in many cases extending in a capelike fashion over the arms, back, and shoulders. Early weakness in the hands progresses to weakness and muscle spasms in the arms and shoulder girdle. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes and spastic weakness of the legs may develop. However, if the lesion affects the lumbar spine, hypoactive deep tendon reflexes and flaccid weakness may persist in the legs.

    With brain stem involvement, additional findings include facial analgesia and thermanesthesia, vertigo, nystagmus, atrophy of the tongue, and dysarthria. The patient may also have dysphagia, urine retention, anhidrosis, decreased intestinal motility, and hyperkeratosis.

- ***Spinal cord hemisection.*** Contralateral analgesia and thermanesthesia occur below the level of the lesion. In addition, loss of proprioception, spastic paralysis, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes develop ipsilaterally. The patient may also experience urine retention with overflow incontinence.

**Other Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.057.png) ***Drugs.*** Analgesia may occur with use of a topical or local anesthetic, although numbness and tingling are more common.

**Special Considerations**

Prepare the patient for spinal X-rays, and maintain spinal alignment and stability during transport to radiology.

Focus your care on preventing further injury to the patient because analgesia can mask injury or developing complications. Prevent formation of pressure ulcers through meticulous skin care, massage, use of lamb’s wool pads, and frequent repositioning, especially when significant motor deficits hamper the patient’s movement.

**Patient Counseling**

Advise the patient to test the bath water temperature at home using a thermometer or a body part with intact sensation. Explain all tests and procedures, and teach the patient about the diagnosis, once established, and about the treatment plan.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because a child may have difficulty describing analgesia, observe him carefully during the assessment for nonverbal clues to pain, such as facial expressions, crying, and retraction from stimuli. Remember that pain thresholds are high in infants, so your assessment findings may not be reliable. Also, remember to test bathwater carefully for a child who’s too young to test it himself.

**Anhidrosis**

Anhidrosis, an abnormal deficiency of sweat, can be classified as generalized (complete) or localized (partial). Generalized anhidrosis can lead to life- threatening impairment of thermoregulation. Localized anhidrosis rarely interferes with thermoregulation because it affects only a small percentage of the body’s eccrine (sweat) glands.

Anhidrosis results from neurologic and skin disorders; congenital, atrophic, or traumatic changes to sweat glands; and the use of certain drugs. Neurologic disorders disturb central or peripheral nervous pathways that normally activate sweating, causing retention of excess body heat and perspiration. The absence, obstruction, atrophy, or degeneration of sweat glands can produce anhidrosis at the skin surface, even if neurologic stimulation is normal. (See *Eccrine Dysfunction in Anhidrosis*, pages 46 and 47.)

Anhidrosis may go unrecognized until significant heat or exertion fails to raise sweat. However, localized anhidrosis commonly provokes compensatory hyperhidrosis in the remaining functional sweat glands — which, in many cases, is the patient’s chief complaint.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If you detect anhidrosis in a patient whose skin feels hot and flushed, ask him if he’s also experiencing nausea, dizziness, palpitations, and substernal tightness. If he is, quickly take his rectal temperature and other vital signs and assess his level of consciousness (LOC). If a rectal temperature higher than 102.2°F (39°C) is accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered blood pressure and LOC, suspect life-threatening anhidrotic* *asthenia (heatstroke). Start rapid cooling measures, such as immersing him in ice or very cold water and giving I.V. fluid replacements. Continue these measures, and check his vital signs and neurologic status frequently, until his temperature drops below 102°F (38.9°C). Then, place him in an air- conditioned room.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If anhidrosis is localized or if the patient reports local hyperhidrosis or unexplained fever, take a brief history. Ask the patient to characterize his sweating during heat spells or strenuous activity. Does he usually sweat slightly or profusely? Ask about recent prolonged or extreme exposure to heat and about the onset of anhidrosis or hyperhidrosis. Obtain a complete medical history, focusing on neurologic disorders; skin disorders, such as psoriasis; autoimmune disorders, such as scleroderma; systemic diseases that can cause peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetes mellitus; and drug use.

Inspect skin color, texture, and turgor. If you detect skin lesions, document their location, size, color, texture, and pattern.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Anhidrotic asthenia (heatstroke).*** A life-threatening disorder, anhidrotic asthenia causes acute, generalized anhidrosis. In early stages, sweating may still occur, and the patient may be rational, but his rectal temperature may already exceed 102.2°F (39°C). Associated signs and symptoms include severe headache and muscle cramps, which later disappear, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, palpitations, substernal tightness, and elevated blood pressure followed by hypotension. Within minutes, anhidrosis and hot, flushed skin develop, accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and confusion progressing to seizure or loss of consciousness.
  - ***Burns.*** Depending on their severity, burns may cause permanent anhidrosis in affected areas as well as blistering, edema, and increased pain or loss of sensation.
    - ***Miliaria crystallina.*** This usually innocuous form of miliaria causes anhidrosis and tiny, clear, fragile blisters, usually under the arms and breasts.
      - ***Miliaria profunda.*** If severe and extensive, miliaria profunda can progress to life-threatening anhidrotic asthenia. Typically, it produces localized anhidrosis with compensatory facial hyperhidrosis. Whitish papules appear mostly on the trunk but also on the extremities. Associated signs and symptoms include inguinal and axillary lymphadenopathy, weakness, shortness of breath, palpitations, and fever.
- ***Miliaria rubra (prickly heat).*** Miliaria rubra typically produces localized anhidrosis and can also progress to life-threatening anhidrotic asthenia if it becomes severe and extensive; however, this is a rare occurrence. Small, erythematous papules with centrally placed blisters appear on the trunk and neck and rarely on the face, palms, or soles. Pustules may also appear in extensive and chronic miliaria. Related symptoms include paroxysmal itching and paresthesia.
  - ***Peripheral neuropathy.*** Anhidrosis over the legs usually appears with compensatory hyperhidrosis over the head and neck. Associated findings mainly involve extremities and include glossy red skin; paresthesia, hyperesthesia, or anesthesia in the hands and feet; diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes; flaccid paralysis and muscle wasting; footdrop; and burning pain.
    - ***Shy-Drager syndrome.*** A degenerative neurologic syndrome, Shy-Drager syndrome causes ascending anhidrosis in the legs. Other signs and symptoms include severe orthostatic hypotension, loss of leg hair, impotence, constipation, urine retention or urgency, decreased salivation and tearing, mydriasis, and impaired visual accommodation. Eventually, focal neurologic signs — such as leg tremors, incoordination, and muscle wasting and fasciculation — may appear.
      - ***Spinal cord lesions.*** Anhidrosis may occur symmetrically below the level of the lesion, with compensatory hyperhidrosis in adjacent areas. Other findings depend on the site and extent of the lesion but may include partial or total loss of motor and sensory function below the lesion as well as impaired cardiovascular and respiratory function.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Anticholinergics, such as atropine and scopolamine, can cause generalized anhidrosis.

**Special Considerations**

Because even a careful evaluation can be inconclusive, you may need to administer specific tests to evaluate anhidrosis. These include wrapping the patient in an electric blanket or placing him in a heated box to observe the skin for sweat patterns, applying a topical agent to detect sweat on the skin, and administering a systemic cholinergic drug to stimulate sweating.

**Patient Counseling**

Advise about ways to stay cool, such as maintaining a cool environment, moving slowly during warm weather, and avoiding strenuous exercise and hot foods. Discuss with the patient the anhidrotic effects of drugs he’s receiving.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In infants and children, miliaria rubra and congenital skin disorders, such as ichthyosis and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, are the most common causes of anhidrosis.

Because delayed development of the thermoregulatory center renders an infant — especially a premature one — anhidrotic for several weeks after birth, caution parents against overdressing their infant.

**Anorexia**

Anorexia, a lack of appetite in the presence of a physiologic need for food, is a common symptom of GI and endocrine disorders and is characteristic of certain severe psychological disturbances such as anorexia nervosa. It can also result from such factors as anxiety, chronic pain, poor oral hygiene, increased blood temperature due to hot weather or fever, and changes in taste or smell that normally accompany aging. Anorexia also can result from drug therapy or abuse. Short-term anorexia rarely jeopardizes health, but chronic anorexia can lead to life-threatening malnutrition.

**History and Physical Examination**

Take the patient’s vital signs and weight. Find out previous minimum and maximum weights. Ask about involuntary weight loss greater than 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the past month. Explore dietary habits such as when and what the patient eats. Ask what foods he likes and dislikes and why. The patient may identify tastes and smells that nauseate him and cause loss of appetite. Ask about dental problems that interfere with chewing, including poor-fitting dentures. Ask if he has difficulty or pain when swallowing or if he vomits or has diarrhea after meals. Ask the patient how frequently and intensely he exercises.

Check for a history of stomach or bowel disorders, which can interfere with the ability to digest, absorb, or metabolize nutrients. Find out about changes in bowel habits. Ask about alcohol use and drug use and dosage.

If the medical history doesn’t reveal an organic basis for anorexia, consider psychological factors. Ask the patient if he knows what’s causing his decreased appetite. Situational factors — such as a death in the family or problems at school or at work — can lead to depression and a subsequent loss of appetite. Be alert for signs of malnutrition, consistent refusal of food, and a 7% to 10% loss of body weight in the preceding month. (See *Is Your Patient Malnourished?*, page 50.)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.*** An infection or Kaposi’s sarcoma affecting the GI or respiratory tract may lead to anorexia. Other findings include fatigue, afternoon fevers, night sweats, diarrhea, cough, lymphadenopathy, bleeding, oral thrush, gingivitis, and skin disorders, including persistent herpes zoster and recurrent herpes simplex, herpes labialis, or herpes genitalis.

When assessing a patient with anorexia, make sure to check for these common signs of malnutrition.

- ***Adrenocortical hypofunction.*** With adrenocortical hypofunction, anorexia may begin slowly and subtly, causing gradual weight loss. Other common signs and symptoms include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, malaise, vitiligo, bronze-colored skin, and purple striae on the breasts, abdomen, shoulders, and hips.
  - ***Alcoholism.*** Chronic anorexia commonly accompanies alcoholism, eventually leading to malnutrition. Other findings include signs of liver damage (jaundice, spider angiomas, ascites, edema), paresthesia, tremors, increased blood pressure, bruising, GI bleeding, and abdominal pain.
    - ***Anorexia nervosa.*** Chronic anorexia begins insidiously and eventually leads to life-threatening malnutrition, as evidenced by skeletal muscle atrophy, loss of fatty tissue, constipation, amenorrhea, dry and blotchy or sallow skin, alopecia, sleep disturbances, distorted self-image, anhedonia, and decreased libido. Paradoxically, the patient typically exhibits extreme restlessness and vigor and may exercise avidly. He also may have complicated food preparation and eating rituals.
      - ***Appendicitis.*** Anorexia closely follows the abrupt onset of generalized or localized epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. It can continue as pain localizes in the right lower quadrant (McBurney’s point), and other signs and symptoms appear: abdominal rigidity, rebound tenderness, constipation (or diarrhea), a slight fever, and tachycardia.
- ***Cancer.*** Chronic anorexia occurs along with possible weight loss, weakness, apathy, and cachexia.
  - ***Chronic renal failure.*** Chronic anorexia is common and insidious. It’s accompanied by changes in all body systems, such as nausea, vomiting, mouth ulcers, ammonia breath odor, metallic taste in the mouth, GI bleeding, constipation or diarrhea, drowsiness, confusion, tremors, pallor, dry and scaly skin, pruritus, alopecia, purpuric lesions, and edema.
    - ***Cirrhosis.*** Anorexia occurs early in cirrhosis and may be accompanied by weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and dull abdominal pain. It continues after these early signs and symptoms subside and is accompanied by lethargy, slurred speech, bleeding tendencies, ascites, severe pruritus, dry skin, poor skin turgor, hepatomegaly, fetor hepaticus, jaundice, leg edema, gynecomastia, and right upper quadrant pain.
      - ***Crohn’s disease.*** Chronic anorexia causes marked weight loss. Associated signs vary according to the site and extent of the lesion, but may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, an abdominal mass, weakness, perianal or vaginal fistulas and, rarely, clubbing of the fingers. Acute inflammatory signs and symptoms — right lower quadrant pain, cramping, tenderness, flatulence, fever, nausea, diarrhea (including nocturnal), and bloody stools
        - mimic those of appendicitis.
        - ***Gastritis.*** With acute gastritis, the onset of anorexia may be sudden. The patient may experience postprandial epigastric distress after a meal, accompanied by nausea, vomiting (commonly with hematemesis), fever, belching, hiccups, and malaise.
          - ***Hepatitis.*** With viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, or D), anorexia begins in the preicteric phase, accompanied by fatigue, malaise, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, a mild fever, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. It may continue throughout the icteric phase, along with mild weight loss, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and, possibly, irritability and severe pruritus. Signs and symptoms of nonviral hepatitis usually resemble those of viral hepatitis but may vary, depending on the cause and extent of liver damage.
    - ***Hypothyroidism.*** Anorexia is common and usually insidious in patients with a thyroid hormone deficiency. Typically, vague early findings include fatigue, forgetfulness, cold intolerance, unexplained weight gain, and constipation. Subsequent findings include decreased mental stability; dry, flaky, and inelastic skin; edema of the face, hands, and feet; ptosis; hoarseness; thick, brittle nails; coarse, broken hair; and signs of decreased cardiac output such as bradycardia. Other common findings include abdominal distention, menstrual irregularities, decreased libido, ataxia, intention tremor, nystagmus, a dull facial expression, and slow reflex relaxation time.
- ***Ketoacidosis.*** Anorexia usually arises gradually and is accompanied by dry, flushed skin; a fruity breath odor; polydipsia; polyuria and nocturia; hypotension; a weak, rapid pulse; a dry mouth; abdominal pain; and vomiting.
  - ***Pernicious anemia.*** With pernicious anemia, insidious anorexia may cause considerable weight loss. Related findings include the classic triad of a burning tongue, general weakness, and numbness and tingling in the extremities; alternating constipation and diarrhea; abdominal pain; nausea and vomiting; bleeding gums; ataxia; positive Babinski’s and Romberg’s signs; diplopia and blurred vision; irritability; headache; malaise; and fatigue.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Anorexia results from the use of amphetamines; chemotherapeutic agents; sympathomimetics, such as ephedrine; and some antibiotics. It also signals digoxin toxicity.
  - ***Radiation therapy.*** Radiation treatments can cause anorexia, possibly as a result of metabolic disturbances.
    - ***Total parenteral nutrition (TPN).*** Maintenance of blood glucose levels by I.V. therapy may cause anorexia.

**Special Considerations**

Because the causes of anorexia are diverse, diagnostic procedures may include thyroid function studies, endoscopy, upper GI series, gallbladder series, barium enema, liver and kidney function tests, hormone assays, computed tomography scans, ultrasonography, and blood studies to assess the patient’s nutritional status.

Promote protein and calorie intake by providing high-calorie snacks or frequent, small meals. You should encourage the patient’s family to supply his favorite foods to help stimulate his appetite. Take a 24-hour diet history daily. The patient may consistently exaggerate his food intake (common in the patient with anorexia nervosa), so you’ll need to maintain strict calorie and nutrient counts for the patient’s meals. In severe malnutrition, provide supplemental nutritional support, such as TPN or oral nutritional supplements.

Because anorexia and poor nutrition increase the patient’s susceptibility to infection, monitor his vital signs and white blood cell count and closely observe any wounds.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the condition, and teach the patient useful techniques to help manage the disorder, including establishing a target weight, recording his daily weight, and maintaining a record of his progress by keeping a weight log. Stress the importance of proper nutrition, and encourage the patient to seek psychological and nutritional counseling.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In a child, anorexia commonly accompanies many illnesses, but usually resolves promptly. However, if the patient is a preadolescent or adolescent girl, be alert for subtle signs of anorexia nervosa.

**Anuria**

Clinically defined as urine output of less than 100 mL in 24 hours, anuria indicates either urinary tract obstruction or acute renal failure due to various mechanisms. (See *Major Causes of Acute Renal Failure*.) Fortunately, anuria is rare; even with renal failure, the kidneys usually produce at least 75 mL of urine daily.

Because urine output is easily measured, anuria rarely goes undetected. However, without immediate treatment, it can rapidly cause uremia and other complications of urine retention.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*After detecting anuria, your priorities are to determine if urine formation is occurring and to intervene appropriately. Prepare to catheterize the patient* *to relieve any lower urinary tract obstruction and to check for residual urine. You may find that an obstruction hinders catheter insertion and that urine return is cloudy and foul smelling. If you collect more than 75 mL of urine, suspect lower urinary tract obstruction; if you collect less than 75 mL, suspect renal dysfunction or obstruction higher in the urinary tract.*

**History and Physical Examination**

Take the patient’s vital signs, and obtain a complete history. First, ask about changes in his voiding pattern. Determine the amount of fluid he normally ingests each day, the amount of fluid he ingested in the last 24 to 48 hours, and the time and amount of his last urination. Review his medical history, noting especially previous kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction or infection, prostate enlargement, renal calculi, neurogenic bladder, or congenital abnormalities. Ask about drug use and about abdominal, renal, or urinary tract surgery.

**Major Causes of Acute Renal Failure![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.060.png)**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.061.png)

Inspect and palpate the abdomen for asymmetry, distention, or bulging. Inspect the flank area for edema or erythema, and percuss and palpate the bladder. Palpate the kidneys anteriorly and posteriorly, and percuss them at the costovertebral angle. Auscultate over the renal arteries, listening for bruits.

**Medical Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.062.png) ***Acute tubular necrosis.*** Oliguria (occasionally anuria) is a common finding with acute tubular necrosis. It precedes the onset of diuresis, which is heralded by polyuria. Associated findings reflect the underlying cause and may include signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia (muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias), uremia (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, confusion,

lethargy, twitching, seizures, pruritus, uremic frost, and Kussmaul’s respirations), and heart failure (edema, jugular vein distention, crackles, and dyspnea).

- ***Cortical necrosis (bilateral).*** Cortical necrosis is characterized by a sudden change from oliguria to anuria, along with gross hematuria, flank pain, and fever.
  - ***Glomerulonephritis (acute).*** Acute glomerulonephritis produces anuria or oliguria. Related effects include a mild fever, malaise, flank pain, gross hematuria, facial and generalized edema, elevated blood pressure, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion (crackles, dyspnea).
    - ***Hemolytic-uremic syndrome.*** Anuria commonly occurs in the initial stages of hemolytic-uremic syndrome and may last from 1 to 10 days. The patient may experience vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena, purpura, fever, elevated blood pressure, hepatomegaly, ecchymoses, edema, hematuria, and pallor. He may also show signs of upper respiratory tract infection.
      - ***Renal artery occlusion (bilateral).*** Renal artery occlusion produces anuria or severe oliguria, commonly accompanied by severe, continuous upper abdominal and flank pain; nausea and vomiting; decreased bowel sounds; a fever up to 102°F (38.9°C); and diastolic hypertension.
        - ***Renal vein occlusion (bilateral).*** Renal vein occlusion occasionally causes anuria; more typical signs and symptoms include acute low back pain, fever, flank tenderness, and hematuria. Development of pulmonary emboli
          - a common complication — produces sudden dyspnea, pleuritic pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles, pleural friction rub and, possibly, hemoptysis.
          - ***Urinary tract obstruction.*** Severe urinary tract obstruction can produce acute and sometimes total anuria, alternating with or preceded by burning and pain on urination, overflow incontinence or dribbling, increased urinary frequency and nocturia, voiding of small amounts, or an altered urine stream. Associated findings include bladder distention, pain and a sensation of fullness in the lower abdomen and groin, upper abdominal and flank pain, nausea and vomiting, and signs of secondary infection, such as fever, chills, malaise, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine.
            - ***Vasculitis.*** Vasculitis occasionally produces anuria. More typical findings include malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia, fever, elevated blood pressure, hematuria, proteinuria, arrhythmia, pallor and, possibly, skin lesions, urticaria, and purpura.

**Other Causes**

- ***Diagnostic tests.*** Contrast media used in radiographic studies can cause nephrotoxicity, producing oliguria and, rarely, anuria.
  - ***Drugs.*** Many classes of drugs can cause anuria or, more commonly, oliguria through their nephrotoxic effects. Antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides, are the most commonly seen nephrotoxins. Anesthetics, heavy metals, ethyl alcohol, and organic solvents can also be nephrotoxic. Adrenergics and anticholinergics can cause anuria by affecting the nerves and muscles of micturition to produce urine retention.

**Special Considerations**

If catheterization fails to initiate urine flow, prepare the patient for diagnostic studies — such as ultrasonography, cystoscopy, retrograde pyelography, and renal scan — to detect any obstruction higher in the urinary tract. If these tests reveal an obstruction, prepare him for immediate surgery to remove the obstruction, and insert a nephrostomy or ureterostomy tube to drain the urine. If these tests fail to reveal an obstruction, prepare the patient for further kidney function studies.

Carefully monitor the patient’s vital signs and intake and output, initially saving any urine for inspection. Restrict daily fluid allowance to 600 mL more than the previous day’s total urine output. Restrict foods and juices high in potassium and sodium, and make sure that the patient maintains a balanced diet with controlled protein levels. Provide low-sodium hard candy to help decrease thirst. Record fluid intake and output, and weigh the patient daily.

**Patient Counseling**

Discuss fluids and foods the patient should avoid. Instruct the patient on nephrostomy tube or ureterostomy tube care, if needed.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In neonates, anuria is defined as the absence of urine output for 24 hours. It can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary anuria results from bilateral renal agenesis, aplasia, or multicystic dysplasia. Secondary anuria, associated with edema or dehydration, results from renal ischemia, renal vein thrombosis, or congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract. Anuria in children commonly results from loss of renal function.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In elderly patients, anuria is a gradually occurring sign of underlying pathology. Hospitalized or bedridden elderly patients may be unable to generate the necessary pressure to void if they remain in a supine position.

**Anxiety**

Anxiety is the most common psychiatric symptom and can result in significant impairment. A subjective reaction to a real or imagined threat, anxiety is a nonspecific feeling of uneasiness or dread. It may be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild anxiety may cause slight physical or psychological discomfort. Severe anxiety may be incapacitating or even life threatening.

Everyone experiences anxiety from time to time — it’s a normal response to actual danger, prompting the body (through stimulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems) to purposeful action. It’s also a normal response to physical and emotional stress, which can be produced by virtually any illness. In addition, anxiety can be precipitated or exacerbated by many nonpathologic factors, including lack of sleep, poor diet, and excessive intake of caffeine or other stimulants. However, excessive, unwarranted anxiety may indicate an underlying psychological problem.

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient displays acute, severe anxiety, quickly take his vital signs and determine his chief complaint; this will serve as a guide for how to proceed. For example, if the patient’s anxiety occurs with chest pain and shortness of breath, you might suspect myocardial infarction and act accordingly. While examining the patient, try to keep him calm. Suggest relaxation techniques, and talk to him in a reassuring, soothing voice. Uncontrolled anxiety can alter vital signs and exacerbate the causative disorder.

If the patient displays mild or moderate anxiety, ask about its duration. Is the

anxiety constant or sporadic? Did he notice precipitating factors? Find out if the anxiety is exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, or caffeine intake and alleviated by rest, tranquilizers, or exercise.

Obtain a complete medical history, especially noting drug use. Then, perform a physical examination, focusing on any complaints that may trigger or be aggravated by anxiety.

If the patient’s anxiety isn’t accompanied by significant physical signs, suspect a psychological basis. Determine the patient’s level of consciousness (LOC), and observe his behavior. If appropriate, refer the patient for psychiatric evaluation.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Acute respiratory distress syndrome.*** Acute anxiety occurs along with tachycardia, mental sluggishness and, in severe cases, hypotension. Other respiratory signs and symptoms include dyspnea, tachypnea, intercostal and suprasternal retractions, crackles, and rhonchi.
  - ***Anaphylactic shock.*** Acute anxiety usually signals the onset of anaphylactic shock. It’s accompanied by urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, and shortness of breath. Soon, other signs and symptoms develop: light- headedness, hypotension, tachycardia, nasal congestion, sneezing, wheezing, dyspnea, a barking cough, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and urinary urgency and incontinence.
    - ***Angina pectoris.*** Acute anxiety may either precede or follow an attack of angina pectoris. An attack produces sharp and crushing substernal or anterior chest pain that may radiate to the back, neck, arms, or jaw. The pain may be relieved by nitroglycerin or rest, which eases anxiety.
      - ***Asthma.*** With allergic asthma attacks, acute anxiety occurs with dyspnea, wheezing, a productive cough, accessory muscle use, hyperresonant lung fields, diminished breath sounds, coarse crackles, cyanosis, tachycardia, and diaphoresis.
        - ***Autonomic hyperreflexia.*** The earliest signs of autonomic hyperreflexia may be acute anxiety accompanied by severe headache and dramatic hypertension. Pallor and motor and sensory deficits occur below the level of the lesion; flushing occurs above it.
          - ***Cardiogenic shock.*** Acute anxiety is accompanied by cool, pale, clammy skin; tachycardia; a weak, thready pulse; tachypnea; ventricular gallop; crackles; jugular vein distention; decreased urine output; hypotension; narrowing pulse pressure; and peripheral edema.
- ***Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).*** Acute anxiety, exertional dyspnea, cough, wheezing, crackles, hyperresonant lung fields, tachypnea, and accessory muscle use characterize COPD.
  - ***Heart failure.*** With heart failure, acute anxiety is commonly the first symptom of inadequate oxygenation. Associated findings include restlessness, shortness of breath, tachypnea, decreased LOC, edema, crackles, ventricular gallop, hypotension, diaphoresis, and cyanosis.
    - ***Hyperthyroidism.*** Acute anxiety may be an early sign of hyperthyroidism. Classic signs and symptoms include heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sweating, an enlarged thyroid, and diarrhea. Exophthalmos may occur.
      - ***Mitral valve prolapse.*** Panic may occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse, referred to as the *click-murmur syndrome*. The disorder may also cause paroxysmal palpitations accompanied by sharp, stabbing, or aching precordial pain. Its hallmark is a midsystolic click, followed by an apical systolic murmur.
        - ***Mood disorder.*** Anxiety may be the patient’s chief complaint in the depressive or manic form of mood disorder. With the depressive form, chronic anxiety occurs with varying severity. Associated findings include dysphoria; anger; insomnia or hypersomnia; decreased libido, interest, energy, and concentration; appetite disturbance; multiple somatic complaints; and suicidal thoughts. With the manic form, the patient’s chief complaint may be a reduced need for sleep, hyperactivity, increased energy, rapid or pressured speech and, in severe cases, paranoid ideas and other psychotic symptoms.
          - ***Myocardial infarction (MI).*** With MI, a life-threatening disorder, acute anxiety commonly occurs with persistent, crushing substernal pain that may radiate to the left arm, jaw, neck, or shoulder blades. It can be accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and cool pale skin.
            - ***Obsessive-compulsive disorder.*** Chronic anxiety occurs with obsessive- compulsive disorder, along with recurrent, unshakable thoughts or impulses to perform ritualistic acts. The patient recognizes these acts as irrational, but is unable to control them. Anxiety builds if he can’t perform these acts and diminishes after he does.
              - ***Pheochromocytoma.*** Acute, severe anxiety accompanies pheochromocytoma’s cardinal sign: persistent or paroxysmal hypertension. Common associated signs and symptoms include tachycardia, diaphoresis, orthostatic hypotension, tachypnea, flushing, a severe headache, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and paresthesia.
- ***Phobias.*** With phobias, chronic anxiety occurs along with a persistent fear of an object, activity, or situation that results in a compelling desire to avoid it. The patient recognizes the fear as irrational, but can’t suppress it.
  - ***Pneumonia.*** Acute anxiety may occur with pneumonia because of hypoxemia. Other findings include a productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, fever, chills, crackles, diminished breath sounds, and hyperresonant lung fields.
    - ***Pneumothorax.*** Acute anxiety occurs in moderate to severe pneumothorax associated with profound respiratory distress. It’s accompanied by sharp pleuritic pain, coughing, shortness of breath, cyanosis, asymmetrical chest expansion, pallor, jugular vein distention, and a weak, rapid pulse.
      - ***Postconcussion syndrome.*** Postconcussion syndrome may produce chronic anxiety or periodic attacks of acute anxiety. Associated signs and symptoms include irritability, insomnia, dizziness, and a mild headache. The anxiety is usually most pronounced in situations demanding attention, judgment, or comprehension.
        - ***Posttraumatic stress disorder.*** Posttraumatic stress disorder occurs in the patient who has experienced an extreme traumatic event. It produces chronic anxiety of varying severity and is accompanied by intrusive, vivid memories and thoughts of the traumatic event. The patient also relives the event in dreams and nightmares. Insomnia, depression, and feelings of numbness and detachment are common.
          - ***Pulmonary edema.*** With pulmonary edema, acute anxiety occurs with dyspnea, orthopnea, cough with frothy sputum, tachycardia, tachypnea, crackles, ventricular gallop, hypotension, and a thready pulse. The patient’s skin may be cool, clammy, and cyanotic.
            - ***Pulmonary embolism.*** With pulmonary embolism, acute anxiety is usually accompanied by dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain, tachycardia, blood-tinged sputum, and a low-grade fever.
              - ***Rabies.*** Anxiety signals the beginning of the acute phase of rabies, a rare disorder, which is commonly accompanied by painful laryngeal spasms associated with difficulty swallowing and, as a result, hydrophobia.
    - ***Somatoform disorder.*** Somatoform disorder, which usually begins in young adulthood, is characterized by anxiety and multiple somatic complaints that can’t be explained physiologically. The symptoms aren’t produced intentionally, but are severe enough to significantly impair functioning. Pain disorder, conversion disorder, and hypochondriasis are examples of somatoform disorder.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Many drugs cause anxiety, especially sympathomimetics and central nervous system stimulants. In addition, many antidepressants may cause paradoxical anxiety.

**Special Considerations**

Supportive care usually helps relieve anxiety. Provide a calm, quiet atmosphere, and make the patient comfortable. Encourage him to express his feelings and concerns freely. If it helps, take a short walk with him while you’re talking. Or, try anxiety-reducing measures, such as distraction, relaxation techniques, or biofeedback.

**Patient Counseling**

Instruct the patient on relaxation techniques, and help him to identify stressors and to understand more about coping mechanisms. Encourage the patient’s verbalization of anxiety.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Anxiety in children usually results from painful physical illness or inadequate oxygenation. Its autonomic signs tend to be more common and dramatic than in adults.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In an elderly patient, distractions from ritual activity may provoke anxiety or agitation.

**Aphasia [Dysphasia]**

Aphasia, impaired expression or comprehension of written or spoken language,

reflects disease or injury of the brain’s language centers. (See *Where Language Originates*.) Depending on its severity, aphasia may slightly impede communication or may make it impossible. It can be classified as Broca’s, Wernicke’s, anomic, or global aphasia. Anomic aphasia eventually resolves in more than 50% of patients, but global aphasia is usually irreversible. (See *Identifying Types of Aphasia*, page 60.)

**Where Language Originates![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.063.png)**

Aphasia reflects damage to one or more of the brain’s primary language centers, which, in most persons, are located in the left hemisphere. *Broca’s area* lies next to the region of the motor cortex that controls the muscles necessary for speech. *Wernicke’s area* is the center of auditory, visual, and language comprehension. It lies between *Heschl’s gyrus,* the primary receiver of auditory stimuli, and the *angular gyrus,* a “way station” between the brain’s auditory and visual regions. Connecting Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas is a large nerve bundle, the *arcuate fasciculus*, which enables the repetition of speech.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.064.png)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Quickly look for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as pupillary changes, a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), vomiting, seizures, bradycardia, widening pulse pressure, and irregular respirations. If you detect signs of increased ICP, administer mannitol I.V. to decrease cerebral edema. In addition, make sure that emergency resuscitation equipment is readily available to support respiratory and cardiac function, if necessary. You may have to prepare the patient for emergency surgery.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient doesn’t display signs of increased ICP or if his aphasia has developed gradually, perform a thorough neurologic examination, starting with the patient history. You’ll probably need to obtain this history from the patient’s family or companion because of the patient’s impairment. Ask if the patient has a history of headaches, hypertension, seizure disorders, or drug use. Also ask about the patient’s ability to communicate and to perform routine activities before aphasia began.

**Identifying Types of Aphasia![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.065.png)**


![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.066.png)

Check for obvious signs of neurologic deficit, such as ptosis or fluid leakage from the nose and ears. Take the patient’s vital signs and assess his LOC. Be aware, however, that assessing LOC is usually difficult because the patient’s verbal responses may be unreliable. Also, recognize that dysarthria (impaired articulation due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles necessary for speech) or speech apraxia (inability to voluntarily control the muscles of speech) may accompany aphasia; therefore, speak slowly and distinctly, and allow the patient ample time to respond. Assess the patient’s pupillary response, eye movements, and motor function, especially his mouth and tongue movement, swallowing ability, and spontaneous movements and gestures. To best assess motor function, first demonstrate the motions and then have the patient imitate them.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Alzheimer’s disease.*** With Alzheimer’s, a degenerative disease, anomic aphasia may begin insidiously and then progress to severe global aphasia.

Associated signs and symptoms include behavioral changes, loss of memory, poor judgment, restlessness, myoclonus, and muscle rigidity. Incontinence is usually a late sign.

- ***Brain abscess.*** Any type of aphasia may occur with brain abscess. Usually, aphasia develops insidiously and may be accompanied by hemiparesis, ataxia, facial weakness, and signs of increased ICP.
  - ***Brain tumor.*** A brain tumor may cause any type of aphasia. As the tumor enlarges, other aphasias may occur along with behavioral changes, memory loss, motor weakness, seizures, auditory hallucinations, visual field deficits, and increased ICP.
    - ***Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.*** Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia accompanied by neurologic signs and symptoms, such as myoclonic jerking, ataxia, aphasia, visual disturbances, and paralysis. It generally affects adults ages 40 to 65.
      - ***Encephalitis.*** Encephalitis usually produces transient aphasia. Its early signs and symptoms include fever, headache, and vomiting. Seizures, confusion, stupor or coma, hemiparesis, asymmetrical deep tendon reflexes, positive Babinski’s reflex, ataxia, myoclonus, nystagmus, ocular palsies, and facial weakness may accompany aphasia.
        - ***Head trauma.*** Any type of aphasia may accompany severe head trauma; typically, it occurs suddenly and may be transient or permanent, depending on the extent of brain damage. Associated signs and symptoms include blurred or double vision, headache, pallor, diaphoresis, numbness and paresis, cerebrospinal otorrhea or rhinorrhea, altered respirations, tachycardia, disorientation, behavioral changes, and signs of increased ICP.
          - ***Seizures.*** Seizures and the postictal state may cause transient aphasia if the seizures involve the language centers.
            - ***Stroke.*** The most common cause of aphasia, stroke may produce Wernicke’s, Broca’s, or global aphasia. Associated findings include decreased LOC, right-sided hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia, paresthesia, and loss of sensation. (These signs and symptoms may appear on the left side if the right hemisphere contains the language centers.)
              - ***Transient ischemic attack.*** Transient ischemic attacks can produce any type of aphasia, which occurs suddenly and resolves within 24 hours of the attack. Associated signs and symptoms include transient hemiparesis, hemianopsia, and paresthesia (all usually right-sided), dizziness, and confusion.

**Special Considerations**

Immediately after aphasia develops, the patient may become confused or disoriented. Help to restore a sense of reality by frequently telling him what has happened, where he is and why, and what the date is. Carefully explain diagnostic tests, such as skull X-rays, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and EEG. Later, expect periods of depression as the patient recognizes his disability. Help him to communicate by providing a relaxed, accepting environment with a minimum of distracting stimuli.

Be alert for sudden outbursts of profanity by the patient. This common behavior usually reflects intense frustration with his impairment. Deal with such outbursts as gently as possible to ease embarrassment.

When you speak to the patient, don’t assume that he understands you. He may simply be interpreting subtle clues to meaning, such as social context, facial expressions, and gestures. To help avoid misunderstanding, use nonverbal techniques, speak to him in simple phrases, and use demonstration to clarify your verbal directions.

Remember that aphasia is a language disorder, not an emotional or auditory one, so speak to the patient in a normal tone of voice. Make sure that he has necessary aids, such as eyeglasses or dentures, to facilitate communication. Printed communication cards can assist him to communicate his basic needs. Refer the patient to a speech pathologist early to help him cope with his aphasia.

**Patient Counseling**

Discuss alternate means of communication and ways to reduce the risk factors for stroke.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Recognize that the term *childhood aphasia* is sometimes mistakenly applied to children who fail to develop normal language skills but who aren’t considered mentally retarded or developmentally delayed. *Aphasia* refers solely to a loss of previously developed communication skills.

Brain damage associated with aphasia in children most commonly follows anoxia — the result of near drowning or airway obstruction.

**Apnea**

Apnea, the cessation of spontaneous respiration, is occasionally temporary and self-limiting, as occurs during Cheyne-Stokes and Biot’s respirations. More commonly, however, it’s a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent death.

Apnea usually results from one or more of six pathophysiologic mechanisms, each of which has numerous causes. Its most common causes include trauma, cardiac arrest, neurologic disease, aspiration of foreign objects, bronchospasm, and drug overdose. (See *Causes of Apnea*.)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If you detect apnea, first establish and maintain a patent airway. Position the patient in a supine position, and open his airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift technique. (Caution: If the patient has an obvious or suspected head or neck injury, use the jaw-thrust technique to prevent hyperextending the neck.) Next, quickly look, listen, and feel for spontaneous respiration; if it’s absent, begin artificial ventilation until it occurs or until mechanical ventilation can be initiated.*

*Because apnea may result from cardiac arrest (or may cause it), assess the patient’s carotid pulse immediately after you’ve established a patent airway. Or, if the patient is an infant or small child, assess the brachial pulse instead. If you can’t palpate a pulse, begin cardiac compression.*

**History and Physical Examination**

When the patient’s respiratory and cardiac status is stable, investigate the underlying cause of apnea. Ask him (or, if he’s unable to answer, anyone who witnessed the episode) about the onset of apnea and events immediately preceding it. The cause may become readily apparent, as in trauma.

Take a patient history, noting especially reports of headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, sore throat, or dyspnea. Ask about a history of respiratory, cardiac, or neurologic disease and about allergies and drug use.

Inspect the head, face, neck, and trunk for soft tissue injury, hemorrhage, or skeletal deformity. Don’t overlook obvious clues, such as oral and nasal secretions reflecting fluid-filled airways and alveoli or facial soot and singed nasal hair suggesting thermal injury to the tracheobronchial tree.

Auscultate over all lung lobes for adventitious breath sounds, particularly crackles and rhonchi, and percuss the lung fields for increased dullness or hyperresonance. Move on to the heart, auscultating for murmurs, pericardial friction rub, and arrhythmia. Check for cyanosis, pallor, jugular vein distention, and edema. If appropriate, perform a neurologic assessment. Evaluate the patient’s level of consciousness (LOC), orientation, and mental status; test cranial nerve function and motor function, sensation, and reflexes in all extremities.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Airway obstruction.*** Occlusion or compression of the trachea, central airways, or smaller airways can cause sudden apnea by blocking the patient’s airflow and producing acute respiratory failure.
  - ***Brain stem dysfunction.*** Primary or secondary brain stem dysfunction can cause apnea by destroying the brain stem’s ability to initiate respirations. Apnea may arise suddenly (as in trauma, hemorrhage, or infarction) or gradually (as in degenerative disease or tumor). Apnea may be preceded by a decreased LOC and by various motor and sensory deficits.
    - ***Neuromuscular failure.*** Trauma or disease can disrupt the mechanics of respiration, causing sudden or gradual apnea. Associated findings include diaphragmatic or intercostal muscle paralysis from injury or respiratory weakness or paralysis from acute or degenerative disease.
      - ***Parenchymatous lung disease.*** An accumulation of fluid within the alveoli produces apnea by interfering with pulmonary gas exchange and producing acute respiratory failure. Apnea may arise suddenly, as in near drowning and acute pulmonary edema, or gradually, as in emphysema. Apnea may also be preceded by crackles and labored respirations with accessory muscle use.
        - ***Pleural pressure gradient disruption.*** Conversion of normal negative pleural air pressure to positive pressure by chest wall injuries (such as flail chest) causes lung collapse, producing respiratory distress and, if untreated, apnea. Associated signs include an asymmetrical chest wall and asymmetrical or paradoxical respirations.
          - ***Pulmonary capillary perfusion decrease.*** Apnea can stem from obstructed pulmonary circulation, most commonly due to heart failure or lack of circulatory patency. It occurs suddenly in cardiac arrest, massive pulmonary embolism, and most cases of severe shock. In contrast, it occurs progressively in septic shock and pulmonary hypertension. Related findings include hypotension, tachycardia, and edema.
            - ***Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).*** Apnea, coughing, rapid breathing, wheezing, nasal flaring, fever, chest retractions, and upper respiratory symptoms may occur with RSV bronchiolitis, an infection of the lower respiratory tract commonly seen in children younger than 1 year old. RSV infection results in edema that causes narrowing of the airway and inadequate oxygenation. Some children lose interest in eating and drinking and may need to be hydrated. Most children recover from RSV infection within 8 to 15 days without sequelae. Premature infants and those with underlying respiratory, cardiac, neuromuscular, and immunological conditions require special consideration.

**Other Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.070.png) ***Drugs.*** Central nervous system (CNS) depressants may cause hypoventilation and apnea. Benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression and apnea when given I.V. along with other CNS depressants to elderly or acutely ill patients. Neuromuscular blockers — such as curariform drugs and anticholinesterases — may produce sudden apnea because of respiratory muscle paralysis.

- ***Sleep-related apneas.*** These repetitive apneas occur during sleep from airflow obstruction or brain stem dysfunction.

**Special Considerations**

Closely monitor the patient’s cardiac and respiratory status to prevent further episodes of apnea.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the underlying cause and treatment plan, and teach safety measures to reduce the risk of aspiration and ways to avoid episodes of apnea, based on its cause. Encourage the patient’s family to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

**Pediatric Pointers**

Premature neonates are especially susceptible to periodic episodes of apnea because of CNS immaturity. Other common causes include sepsis, intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizures, bronchiolitis, RSV, and sudden infant death syndrome.

In toddlers and older children, the primary cause of apnea is acute airway obstruction from aspiration of foreign objects. Other causes include acute epiglottiditis, croup, asthma, and systemic disorders, such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In elderly patients, increased sensitivity to analgesics, sedative-hypnotics, or a combination of these drugs may produce apnea, even with normal dosage ranges.

**Apneustic Respirations**

Apneustic respirations are characterized by prolonged, gasping inspiration, with a pause at full inspiration. This irregular breathing pattern is an important localizing sign of severe brain stem damage.

Involuntary breathing is primarily regulated by groups of neurons located in respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons. In the medulla, neurons react to impulses from the pons and other areas to regulate respiratory rate and depth. In the pons, two respiratory centers regulate respiratory rhythm by interacting with the medullary respiratory center to smooth the transition from inspiration to expiration and back. The apneustic center in the pons stimulates inspiratory neurons in the medulla to precipitate inspiration. These inspiratory neurons, in turn, stimulate the pneumotaxic center in the pons to precipitate expiration. Destruction of neural pathways by pontine lesions disrupts normal regulation of respiratory rhythm, causing apneustic respirations.

Apneustic respirations must be differentiated from bradypnea and hyperpnea (disturbances in rate and depth, but not in rhythm), Cheyne-Stokes respirations (rhythmic alterations in rate and depth, followed by periods of apnea), and Biot’s respirations (irregularly alternating periods of hyperpnea and apnea).

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Your first priority for a patient with apneustic respirations is to ensure*

*adequate ventilation. You’ll need to insert an artificial airway and administer oxygen until mechanical ventilation can begin. Next, thoroughly evaluate the patient’s neurologic status, using a standardized tool such as the Glasgow Coma Scale. Finally, obtain a brief patient history from a family member, if possible.*

**Medical Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.071.png) ***Pontine lesions.*** Apneustic respirations usually result from extensive damage to the upper or lower pons due to infarction, hemorrhage, herniation, severe infection, tumor, or trauma. Typically, these respirations are accompanied by profound stupor or coma; pinpoint midline pupils; ocular bobbing (a spontaneous downward jerk, followed by a slow drift up to midline); quadriplegia or, less commonly, hemiplegia with the eyes pointing toward the weak side; a positive Babinski’s reflex; negative oculocephalic and oculovestibular reflexes; and, possibly, decorticate posture.

**Special Considerations**

Constantly monitor the patient’s neurologic and respiratory status. Watch for prolonged periods of apnea or signs of neurologic deterioration. Monitor the patient’s arterial blood gas levels, or use a pulse oximetry device. If appropriate, prepare him for neurologic tests, such as EEG and computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient and his family about his condition and treatment options, and explain all diagnostic tests and procedures.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In young children, avoid using the Glasgow Coma Scale because it requires verbal responses and assumes a certain level of language development.

**Arm Pain**

Arm pain usually results from musculoskeletal disorders, but it can also stem from neurovascular or cardiovascular disorders. (See *Causes of Local Pain*.) In some cases, it may be referred pain from another area, such as the chest, neck, or abdomen. Its location, onset, and character provide clues to its cause. The pain may affect the entire arm or only the upper arm or forearm. It may arise suddenly or gradually and may be constant or intermittent. Arm pain can be described as sharp or dull, burning or numbing, and shooting or penetrating. Diffuse arm pain, however, may be difficult to describe, especially if it isn’t associated with injury.

**Causes of Local Pain![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.072.png)**

Various disorders cause hand, wrist, elbow, or shoulder pain. In some disorders, pain may radiate from the injury site to other areas.

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient reports arm pain after an injury, take a brief history of the injury from the patient. Then, quickly assess him for severe injuries requiring immediate treatment. If you’ve ruled out severe injuries, check pulses, capillary refill time, sensation, and movement distal to the affected area because circulatory impairment or nerve injury may require immediate surgery. Inspect the arm for deformities, assess the level of pain, and immobilize the arm to prevent further injury.

If the patient reports continuous or intermittent arm pain, ask him to describe it and to relate when it began. Is the pain associated with repetitive or specific movements or positions? Ask him to point out other painful areas because arm pain may be referred. For example, arm pain commonly accompanies the characteristic chest pain of myocardial infarction, and right shoulder pain may be referred from the right upper quadrant abdominal pain of cholecystitis. Ask the patient if the pain worsens in the morning or in the evening, if it prevents him from performing his job, and if it restricts movement. Also ask if heat, rest, or drugs relieve it. Finally, ask about preexisting illnesses, a family history of gout or arthritis, and current drug therapy.

**Arm Pain: Common Causes and Associated Findings![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.075.png)**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.076.png)

Next, perform a focused examination. Observe the way the patient walks, sits, and holds his arm. Inspect the entire arm, comparing it with the opposite arm for symmetry, movement, and muscle atrophy. (It’s important to know if the patient is right-or left-handed.) Palpate the entire arm for swelling, nodules, and tender areas. In both arms, compare active range of motion, muscle strength, and reflexes.

If the patient reports numbness or tingling, check his sensation to vibration, temperature, and pinprick. Compare bilateral hand grasps and shoulder strength to detect weakness.

If a patient has a cast, splint, or restrictive dressing, check for circulation, sensation, and mobility distal to the dressing. Ask the patient about edema and if the pain has worsened within the last 24 hours.

Examine the neck for pain on motion, point tenderness, muscle spasms, or arm pain when the neck is extended with the head toward the involved side. (See *Arm Pain: Common Causes and Associated Findings*.)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Angina.*** Angina may cause inner arm pain as well as chest and jaw pain. Typically, the pain follows exertion and persists for a few minutes. Accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, and apprehension, the pain is relieved by rest or vasodilators such as nitroglycerin.
  - ***Biceps rupture.*** Rupture of the biceps after excessive weight lifting or osteoarthritic degeneration of bicipital tendon insertion at the shoulder can cause pain in the upper arm. Forearm flexion and supination aggravate the pain. Other signs and symptoms include muscle weakness, deformity, and edema.
    - ***Cellulitis.*** Typically, cellulitis affects the legs, but it can also affect the arms. It produces pain as well as redness, tenderness, edema and, at times, fever, chills, tachycardia, headache, and hypotension. Cellulitis usually follows an injury or insect bite.
      - ***Cervical nerve root compression.*** Compression of the cervical nerves supplying the upper arm produces chronic arm and neck pain, which may worsen with movement or prolonged sitting. The patient may also experience muscle weakness, paresthesia, and decreased reflex response.
        - ***Compartment syndrome.*** Severe pain with passive muscle stretching is the cardinal symptom of compartment syndrome. It may also impair distal circulation and cause muscle weakness, decreased reflex response, paresthesia, and edema. Ominous signs include paralysis and an absent pulse.
          - ***Fractures.*** In fractures of the cervical vertebrae, humerus, scapula, clavicle, radius, or ulna, pain can occur at the injury site and radiate throughout the entire arm. Pain at a fresh fracture site is intense and worsens with movement. Associated signs and symptoms include crepitus, felt and heard from bone ends rubbing together (don’t attempt to elicit this sign); deformity, if bones are misaligned; local ecchymosis and edema; impaired distal circulation; paresthesia; and decreased sensation distal to the injury site. Fractures of the small wrist bones can manifest with pain and swelling several days after the trauma.
            - ***Muscle contusion.*** Muscle contusion may cause generalized pain in the area of injury. It may also cause local swelling and ecchymosis.
- ***Muscle strain.*** Acute or chronic muscle strain causes mild to severe pain with movement. The resultant reduction in arm movement may cause muscle weakness and atrophy.
  - ***Myocardial infarction (MI).*** An MI is a life-threatening disorder in which the patient may complain of left arm pain as well as deep and crushing chest pain. He may display weakness, pallor, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, altered blood pressure, tachycardia, dyspnea, and feelings of apprehension or impending doom.
    - ***Neoplasms of the arm.*** Neoplasms of the arm produce continuous, deep, and penetrating arm pain that worsens at night. Occasionally, redness and swelling accompany arm pain; later, skin breakdown, impaired circulation, and paresthesia may occur.
      - ***Osteomyelitis.*** Osteomyelitis typically begins with vague and evanescent localized arm pain and fever and is accompanied by local tenderness, painful and restricted movement and, later, swelling. Associated findings include malaise and tachycardia.

**Special Considerations**

If you suspect a fracture, apply a sling or splint to immobilize the arm, and monitor the patient for worsening pain, numbness, or decreased circulation distal to the injury site. Also, monitor the patient’s vital signs, and be alert for tachycardia, hypotension, and diaphoresis. Withhold food, fluids, and analgesics until potential fractures are evaluated. Promote the patient’s comfort by elevating his arm and applying ice. Clean abrasions and lacerations, and apply dry, sterile dressings, if necessary. Also, prepare the patient for X-rays or other diagnostic tests.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the signs and symptoms of an ischemic event and of circulatory impairment caused by a tight cast.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In children, arm pain commonly results from fractures, muscle sprain, muscular dystrophy, or rheumatoid arthritis. In young children especially, the exact location of the pain may be difficult to establish. Watch for nonverbal clues, such as wincing or guarding.

If the child has a fracture or sprain, obtain a complete account of the injury.

Closely observe interactions between the child and his family, and don’t rule out the possibility of child abuse.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Elderly patients with osteoporosis may experience fractures from simple trauma or even from heavy lifting or unexpected movements. They’re also prone to degenerative joint disease that can involve several joints in the arm or neck.

and future directions. *Current Opinions in Anaesthesiology*, 24, 524–531.

**Asterixis [Liver flap, flapping tremor]**

A bilateral, coarse movement, asterixis is characterized by sudden relaxation of muscle groups holding a sustained posture. This elicited sign is most commonly observed in the wrists and fingers, but may also appear during any sustained voluntary action. Typically, it signals hepatic, renal, or pulmonary disease.

**Recognizing Asterixis![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.077.png)**

With asterixis, the patient’s wrists and fingers are observed to “flap” because there’s a brief, rapid relaxation of dorsiflexion of the wrist.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.078.png)

To elicit asterixis, have the patient extend his arms, dorsiflex his wrists, and spread his fingers (or do this for him, if necessary). Briefly observe him for asterixis. Alternatively, if the patient has a decreased level of consciousness (LOC) but can follow verbal commands, ask him to squeeze two of your fingers. Consider rapid clutching and unclutching indications of asterixis. Or elevate the patient’s leg off the bed, and dorsiflex the foot. Briefly check for asterixis in the ankle. If the patient can tightly close his eyes and mouth, watch for irregular tremulous movements of the eyelids and corners of the mouth. If he can stick out his tongue, observe the patient for continuous quivering. (See *Recognizing Asterixis*.)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Because asterixis may signal serious metabolic deterioration, quickly evaluate the patient’s neurologic status and vital signs. Compare these data with baseline measurements, and watch carefully for acute changes. Continue to closely monitor his neurologic status, vital signs, and urine output.*

*Watch for signs of respiratory insufficiency, and be prepared to provide endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support. Also, be alert for complications of end-stage hepatic, renal, or pulmonary disease.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient has hepatic disease, assess him for early indications of hemorrhage, including restlessness, tachypnea, and cool, moist, pale skin. (If the patient is jaundiced, check for pallor in the conjunctiva and mucous membranes of the mouth.)

It’s important to recognize that hypotension, oliguria, hematemesis, and melena are late signs of hemorrhage. Prepare to insert a large-bore I.V. line for fluid and blood replacement. Position the patient flat in bed with his legs elevated 20 degrees. Begin or continue to administer oxygen.

If the patient has renal disease, briefly review the therapy he has received. If he’s on dialysis, ask about the frequency of treatments to help gauge the severity of disease. Question a family member if the patient’s LOC is significantly decreased.

Then, assess the patient for hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Look for tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, and Kussmaul’s respirations. Prepare to administer sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, dextrose, insulin, or sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

If the patient has pulmonary disease, check for labored respirations, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, and cyanosis, which are critical signs. Prepare to provide ventilatory support via nasal cannula, mask, or intubation and mechanical ventilation.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Hepatic encephalopathy.*** A life-threatening disorder, hepatic encephalopathy initially causes mild personality changes and a slight tremor. The tremor progresses into asterixis — a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy — and is accompanied by lethargy, aberrant behavior, and apraxia. Eventually, the patient becomes stuporous and displays hyperventilation. When he slips into a coma, hyperactive reflexes, a positive Babinski’s sign, and fetor hepaticus are characteristic signs. The patient may also experience bradycardia, decreased respirations, and seizures.
  - ***Severe respiratory insufficiency.*** Characterized by life-threatening respiratory acidosis, severe respiratory insufficiency initially produces headache, restlessness, confusion, apprehension, and decreased reflexes. Eventually, the patient becomes somnolent and may demonstrate asterixis before slipping into a coma. Associated signs and symptoms of respiratory insufficiency include difficulty breathing and rapid, shallow respirations. The patient may be hypertensive in early disease but hypotensive later.
    - ***Uremic syndrome.*** A life-threatening disorder, uremic syndrome initially causes lethargy, somnolence, confusion, disorientation, behavior changes, and irritability. Eventually, signs and symptoms appear in diverse body systems. Asterixis is accompanied by stupor, paresthesia, muscle twitching, fasciculations, and footdrop. Other signs and symptoms include polyuria and nocturia followed by oliguria and, then, anuria; elevated blood pressure; signs of heart failure and pericarditis; deep, gasping respirations (Kussmaul’s respirations); anorexia; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; GI bleeding; weight loss; ammonia breath odor; and metallic taste (dysgeusia).

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Certain drugs, such as the anticonvulsant phenytoin, may cause asterixis.

**Special Considerations**

Provide simple comfort measures, such as allowing frequent rest periods to minimize fatigue and elevating the head of the bed to relieve dyspnea and orthopnea. Administer oil baths, and avoid soap to relieve itching caused by jaundice and uremia. Provide emotional support to the patient and his family.

If the patient is intubated or has a decreased LOC, provide enteral or parenteral nutrition. Closely monitor serum and urine glucose levels to evaluate hyperalimentation. Because the patient will probably be on bed rest, reposition him at least once every 2 hours to prevent skin breakdown. Also, recognize that his debilitated state makes him prone to infection. Observe strict hand-washing and aseptic techniques when changing dressings and caring for invasive lines.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the underlying disorder, treatment plan, and ways to relieve itching. Teach the patient the importance of planning periods of rest. Discuss measures to reduce the risk of infection with the patient and his family.

**Pediatric Pointers**

End-stage hepatic, renal, and pulmonary disease may also cause asterixis in children.

**Ataxia**

Classified as cerebellar or sensory, ataxia refers to incoordination and irregularity of voluntary, purposeful movements. Cerebellar ataxia results from disease of the cerebellum and its pathways to and from the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. It causes gait, trunk, limb, and possibly speech disorders. Sensory ataxia results from impaired position sense (proprioception) due to the interruption of afferent nerve fibers in the peripheral nerves, posterior roots,

posterior columns of the spinal cord, or medial lemnisci or, occasionally, caused by a lesion in both parietal lobes. It causes gait disorders. (See *Identifying*

*Ataxia*.)

Ataxia occurs in acute and chronic forms. Acute ataxia may result from stroke, hemorrhage, or a large tumor in the posterior fossa. With this life- threatening condition, the cerebellum may herniate downward through the foramen magnum behind the cervical spinal cord or upward through the tentorium on the cerebral hemispheres. Herniation may also compress the brain stem. Acute ataxia may also result from drug toxicity or poisoning. Chronic ataxia can be progressive and, at times, can result from acute disease. It can also occur in metabolic and chronic degenerative neurologic disease.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If ataxic movements suddenly develop, examine the patient for signs of increased intracranial pressure and impending herniation. Determine his level of consciousness (LOC), and be alert for pupillary changes, motor weakness or paralysis, neck stiffness or pain, and vomiting. Check his vital signs, especially respirations; abnormal respiratory patterns may quickly lead to respiratory arrest. Elevate the head of the bed. Have emergency resuscitation equipment readily available. Prepare the patient for a computed tomography scan or surgery.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient isn’t in distress, review his history. Ask about multiple sclerosis, diabetes, central nervous system infection, neoplastic disease, previous stroke, and a family history of ataxia. Also, ask about chronic alcohol abuse or prolonged exposure to industrial toxins such as mercury. Find out if the patient’s ataxia developed suddenly or gradually.

If necessary, perform Romberg’s test to help distinguish between cerebellar and sensory ataxia. Instruct the patient to stand with his feet together and his arms at his side. Note his posture and balance, first with his eyes open and then closed. Test results may indicate normal posture and balance (minimal swaying), cerebellar ataxia (swaying and inability to maintain balance with eyes open or closed), or sensory ataxia (increased swaying and inability to maintain balance with eyes closed). Stand close to the patient during this test to prevent his falling.

**CEREBELLAR ATAXIA![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.080.png)**

With cerebellar ataxia, the patient may stagger or lurch in zigzag fashion, turn with extreme difficulty, and lose his balance when his feet are together.

**GAIT ATAXIA**

With gait ataxia, the patient’s gait is wide based, unsteady, and irregular.

**LIMB ATAXIA**

With limb ataxia, the patient loses the ability to gauge distance, speed, and power of movement, resulting in poorly controlled, variable, and inaccurate voluntary movements. He may move too quickly or too slowly, or his movements may break down into component parts, giving him the appearance of a puppet or a robot. Other effects include a coarse, irregular tremor in purposeful movement (but not at rest) and reduced muscle tone.

**SENSORY ATAXIA**

With sensory ataxia, the patient moves abruptly and stomps or taps his feet. This occurs because he throws his feet forward and outward and then brings them down first on the heels and then on the toes. The patient also fixes his eyes on the ground, watching his steps. However, if he can’t watch them, staggering worsens. When he stands with his feet together, he sways or loses his balance.

**SPEECH ATAXIA**

Speech ataxia is a form of dysarthria in which the patient typically speaks slowly and stresses usually unstressed words and syllables. Speech content is unaffected.

**TRUNCAL ATAXIA**

Truncal ataxia is a disturbance in equilibrium in which the patient can’t sit or stand without falling. Also, his head and trunk may bob and sway (titubation). If he can walk, his gait is reeling.

Ataxia may be observed in the patient’s speech, in the movements of his trunk and limbs, or in his gait.

If you test for gait and limb ataxia, be aware that motor weakness may mimic ataxic movements, so check motor strength as well. Gait ataxia may be severe, even when limb ataxia is minimal. With gait ataxia, ask the patient if he tends to fall to one side, or if falling occurs more frequently at night. With truncal ataxia, remember that the patient’s inability to walk or stand, combined with the absence of other signs while he’s lying down, may give the impression of hysteria or drug or alcohol intoxication.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Cerebellar abscess.*** Cerebellar abscess commonly causes limb ataxia on the same side as the lesion as well as gait and truncal ataxia. Typically, the initial symptom is a headache localized behind the ear or in the occipital region, followed by oculomotor palsy, fever, vomiting, an altered LOC, and coma.
  - ***Cerebellar hemorrhage.*** With cerebellar hemorrhage, a life-threatening disorder, ataxia is usually acute but transient. Unilateral or bilateral ataxia affects the trunk, gait, or limbs. The patient initially experiences repeated vomiting, occipital headache, vertigo, oculomotor palsy, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Later signs, such as a decreased LOC or coma, signal impending herniation.
    - ***Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.*** Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia accompanied by neurologic signs and symptoms, such as myoclonic jerking, ataxia, aphasia, visual disturbances, and paralysis. It generally affects adults ages 40 to 65.
      - ***Diabetic neuropathy.*** Peripheral nerve damage due to diabetes mellitus may cause sensory ataxia, extremity pain, slight leg weakness, skin changes, and bowel and bladder dysfunction.
        - ***Diphtheria.*** Within 4 to 8 weeks of the onset of symptoms, a life- threatening neuropathy can produce sensory ataxia. Diphtheria can be accompanied by fever, paresthesia, and paralysis of the limbs and, sometimes, the respiratory muscles.
          - ***Encephalomyelitis.*** Encephalomyelitis is a complication of measles, smallpox, chickenpox, or rubella, or of rabies or smallpox vaccination that may damage cerebrospinal white matter. Rarely, it’s accompanied by cerebellar ataxia. Other signs and symptoms include headache, fever, vomiting, an altered LOC, paralysis, seizures, oculomotor palsy, and pupillary changes.
            - ***Friedreich’s ataxia.*** A progressive familial disorder, Friedreich’s ataxia affects the spinal cord and cerebellum. It causes gait ataxia, followed by truncal, limb, and speech ataxia. Other signs and symptoms include pes cavus, kyphoscoliosis, cranial nerve palsy, and motor and sensory deficits. A positive Babinski’s reflex may appear.
- ***Guillain-Barré syndrome.*** Peripheral nerve involvement usually follows a mild viral infection, rarely leading to sensory ataxia. Guillain-Barré syndrome also causes ascending paralysis and possibly respiratory distress.
  - ***Hepatocerebral degeneration.*** Patients who survive hepatic coma are occasionally left with residual neurologic defects, including mild cerebellar ataxia with a wide-based, unsteady gait. Ataxia may be accompanied by an altered LOC, dysarthria, rhythmic arm tremors, and choreoathetosis of the face, neck, and shoulders.
    - ***Multiple sclerosis (MS).*** Nystagmus and cerebellar ataxia commonly occur in MS, but they aren’t always accompanied by limb weakness and spasticity. Speech ataxia (especially scanning) may occur as well as sensory ataxia from spinal cord involvement. During remissions, ataxia may subside or may even disappear. During exacerbations, it may reappear, worsen, or even become permanent. MS also causes optic neuritis, optic atrophy, numbness and weakness, diplopia, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction.
      - ***Olivopontocerebellar atrophy.*** Olivopontocerebellar atrophy produces gait ataxia and, later, limb and speech ataxia. Rarely, it produces an intention tremor. It’s accompanied by choreiform movements, dysphagia, and loss of sphincter tone.
        - ***Poisoning.*** Chronic arsenic poisoning may cause sensory ataxia, along with headache, seizures, an altered LOC, motor deficits, and muscle aching. Chronic mercury poisoning causes gait and limb ataxia, principally of the arms. It also causes tremors of the extremities, tongue, and lips, mental confusion, mood changes, and dysarthria.
          - ***Polyneuropathy.*** Carcinomatous and myelomatous polyneuropathy may occur before detection of the primary tumor in cancer, multiple myeloma, or Hodgkin’s disease. Signs and symptoms include ataxia, severe motor weakness, muscle atrophy, and sensory loss in the limbs. Pain and skin changes may also occur.
            - ***Porphyria.*** Porphyria affects the sensory and, more frequently, the motor nerves, possibly leading to ataxia. It also causes abdominal pain, mental disturbances, vomiting, headache, focal neurologic defects, an altered LOC, generalized seizures, and skin lesions.
    - ***Posterior fossa tumor.*** Gait, truncal, or limb ataxia is an early sign and may worsen as the tumor enlarges. It’s accompanied by vomiting, headache, papilledema, vertigo, oculomotor palsy, a decreased LOC, and motor and sensory impairments on the same side as the lesion.
      - ***Spinocerebellar ataxia.*** With spinocerebellar ataxia, the patient may initially experience fatigue, followed by stiff-legged gait ataxia. Eventually, limb ataxia, dysarthria, static tremor, nystagmus, cramps, paresthesia, and sensory deficits occur.
- ***Stroke.*** In stroke, occlusions in the vertebrobasilar arteries halt blood flow to cause infarction in the medulla, pons, or cerebellum that may lead to ataxia. Ataxia may occur at the onset of stroke and remain as a residual deficit. Worsening ataxia during the acute phase may indicate extension of the stroke or severe swelling. Ataxia may be accompanied by unilateral or bilateral motor weakness, a possible altered LOC, sensory loss, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, oculomotor palsy, and dysphagia.
  - ***Wernicke’s disease.*** The result of thiamine deficiency, Wernicke’s disease produces gait ataxia and, rarely, intention tremor or speech ataxia. With severe ataxia, the patient may be unable to stand or walk. Ataxia decreases with thiamine therapy. Associated signs and symptoms include nystagmus, diplopia, ocular palsies, confusion, tachycardia, exertional dyspnea, and orthostatic hypotension.

**Other Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.081.png) ***Drugs.*** Toxic levels of anticonvulsants, especially phenytoin, may result in gait ataxia. Toxic levels of anticholinergics and tricyclic antidepressants may also result in ataxia. Aminoglutethimide causes ataxia in about 10% of patients; however, this effect usually disappears 4 to 6 weeks after drug therapy is discontinued.

**Special Considerations**

Prepare the patient for laboratory studies, such as blood tests for toxic drug levels and radiologic tests. Then, focus on helping the patient adapt to his condition. Promote rehabilitation goals, and help ensure the patient’s safety. For example, instruct the patient with sensory ataxia to move slowly, especially when turning or getting up from a chair. Provide a cane or walker for extra support. Ask the patient’s family to check his home for hazards, such as uneven surfaces or the absence of handrails on stairs. If appropriate, refer the patient with progressive disease for counseling.

**Patient Counseling**

Help the patient to identify rehabilitation goals, stress safety measures, and discuss the use of assistive devices. Refer the patient to counseling as needed.

**Pediatric Pointers**

In children, ataxia occurs in acute and chronic forms and results from congenital or acquired disease. Acute ataxia may stem from febrile infection, brain tumors, mumps, and other disorders. Chronic ataxia may stem from Gaucher’s disease, Refsum’s disease, and other inborn errors of metabolism.

When assessing a child for ataxia, consider his level of motor skills and emotional state. Your examination may be limited to observing the child in spontaneous activity and carefully questioning his parents about changes in his motor activity, such as increased unsteadiness or falling. If you suspect ataxia, refer the child for a neurologic evaluation to rule out a brain tumor.

**Aura**

An aura is a sensory or motor phenomenon, idea, or emotion that marks the initial stage of a seizure or the approach of a classic migraine headache. Auras may be classified as cognitive, affective, psychosensory, or psychomotor. (See *Recognizing Types of Auras*.)

When associated with a seizure, an aura stems from an irritable focus in the brain that spreads throughout the cortex. Although an aura was once considered a sign of impending seizure, it’s now considered the first stage of a seizure. Typically, it occurs seconds to minutes before the ictal phase. Its intensity, duration, and type depend on the origin of the irritable focus. For example, an aura of bitter taste commonly accompanies a frontal lobe lesion. Unfortunately, an aura is difficult to describe because the postictal phase of a seizure temporarily alters the patient’s level of consciousness, impairing his memory of the event.

The aura associated with a classic migraine headache results from cranial vasoconstriction. Diagnostically important, it helps distinguish a classic migraine from other types of headaches.

Typically, an aura develops over 10 to 30 minutes and varies in intensity and duration. If the patient recognizes the aura as a warning sign, he may be able to

prevent the headache by taking appropriate drugs.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*When an aura rapidly progresses to the ictal phase of a seizure, quickly evaluate the seizure and be alert for life-threatening complications such as apnea. When an aura heralds a classic migraine, make the patient as comfortable as possible. Place him in a dark, quiet room, and administer drugs to prevent the headache, if necessary.*

**History and Physical Examination**

Obtain a thorough history of the patient’s headaches or seizure history, asking him to describe any sensory or motor phenomena that precede each headache or seizure. Find out how long each headache or seizure typically lasts. Does anything make it worse, such as bright lights, noise, or caffeine? Does anything make it better? Ask the patient about drugs he takes for pain relief.

**Recognizing Types of Auras![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.082.png)**

Determining whether an aura marks the patient’s thought processes, emotions, or sensory or motor function usually requires keen observation. An aura is typically difficult to describe and is only dimly remembered when associated with seizure activity. Below, you’ll find the types of auras the patient may experience.

**AFFECTIVE AURAS**

Fear

Paranoia

Other emotions

**COGNITIVE AURAS**

Déjà vu (familiarity with unfamiliar events or environments) Flashback of past events

*Jamais vu* (unfamiliarity with a known event)

Time standing still

**PSYCHOMOTOR AURAS![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.083.png)**

Automatisms (inappropriate, repetitive movements): lip smacking, chewing, swallowing, grimacing, picking at clothes, climbing stairs

**PSYCHOSENSORY AURAS**

Auditory: buzzing or ringing in the ears Gustatory: acidic, metallic, or bitter tastes Olfactory: foul odors

Tactile: numbness or tingling

Vertigo

Visual: flashes of light (scintillations)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Classic migraine headache.*** A migraine is preceded by a vague premonition and then, usually, a visual aura involving flashes of light. The aura lasts 10 to 30 minutes and may intensify until it completely obscures the patient’s vision. A classic migraine may cause numbness or tingling of the lips, face, or hands, slight confusion, and dizziness before the characteristic unilateral, throbbing headache appears. It slowly intensifies; when it peaks, it may cause photophobia, nausea, and vomiting.
  - ***Seizure, generalized tonic-clonic.*** A generalized tonic-clonic seizure may begin with or without an aura. The patient loses consciousness and falls to the ground. His body stiffens (tonic phase), and then he experiences rapid, synchronous muscle jerking and hyperventilation (clonic phase). The seizure usually lasts 2 to 5 minutes.

**Special Considerations**

Advise the patient to keep a diary of factors that precipitate each headache as well as associated symptoms to help you evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapy, and recommend lifestyle changes. Stress reduction measures usually play a role here.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient stress reduction measures. If the patient recognizes the aura as

a warning sign, tell him to prevent the headache by taking the appropriate medications. Explain the underlying disorder and any diagnostic tests or procedures. If the patient has a seizure disorder, emphasize the importance of taking anticonvulsants as directed. Stress the importance of regular follow-up appointments for blood studies.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Watch for nonverbal clues possibly associated with aura, such as rubbing the eyes, coughing, and spitting. When taking the seizure history, recognize that children — like adults — tend to forget the aura. Ask simple, direct questions, such as “Do you see anything funny before the seizure?” and “Do you get a bad taste in your mouth?” Give the child ample time to respond because he may have difficulty describing the aura.

**Babinski’s Reflex**

**[Extensor plantar reflex]**

Babinski’s reflex — dorsiflexion of the great toe with extension and fanning of the other toes — is an abnormal reflex elicited by firmly stroking the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot with a moderately sharp object. (See *How to Elicit Babinski’s Reflex*, page 80.) In some patients, this reflex can be triggered by noxious stimuli, such as pain, noise, or even bumping the bed. An indicator of corticospinal damage, Babinski’s reflex may occur unilaterally or bilaterally and may be temporary or permanent. A temporary Babinski’s reflex commonly occurs during the postictal phase of a seizure, whereas a permanent Babinski’s reflex occurs with corticospinal damage. A positive Babinski’s reflex is normal in neonates and in infants up to 24 months old.

**History and Physical Examination**

After eliciting a positive Babinski’s reflex, evaluate the patient for other neurologic signs. Evaluate muscle strength in each extremity by having the patient push or pull against your resistance. Passively flex and extend the extremity to assess muscle tone. Intermittent resistance to flexion and extension indicates spasticity, and a lack of resistance indicates flaccidity.

Next, check for evidence of incoordination by asking the patient to perform a repetitive activity. Test deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) in the patient’s elbow, antecubital area, wrist, knee, and ankle by striking the tendon with a reflex hammer. An exaggerated muscle response indicates hyperactive DTRs; little or no muscle response indicates hypoactivity.

Then, evaluate pain sensation and proprioception in the feet. As you move the patient’s toes up and down, ask the patient to identify the direction in which the toes have been moved without looking at his feet.


**Medical Causes**

- ***Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).*** With this progressive motor neuron disorder, bilateral Babinski’s reflex may occur with hyperactive DTRs and spasticity. Typically, ALS produces fasciculations accompanied by muscle atrophy and weakness. Incoordination makes carrying out activities of daily living difficult for the patient. Associated signs and symptoms include impaired speech; difficulty chewing, swallowing, and breathing; urinary frequency and urgency; and, occasionally, choking and excessive drooling. Although his mental status remains intact, the patient’s poor prognosis may cause periodic depression. Progressive bulbar palsy involves the brain stem and may cause episodes of crying or inappropriate laughter.
  - ***Brain tumor.*** A brain tumor that involves the corticospinal tract may produce Babinski’s reflex. The reflex may be accompanied by hyperactive DTRs (unilateral or bilateral), spasticity, seizures, cranial nerve dysfunction, hemiparesis or hemiplegia, decreased pain sensation, an unsteady gait, incoordination, headache, emotional lability, and a decreased level of consciousness (LOC).

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP How to Elicit Babinski’s![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.086.png)**

**Reflex**

To elicit Babinski’s reflex, stroke the lateral aspect of the sole of the patient’s foot with your thumbnail or another moderately sharp object. Normally, this elicits flexion of all toes (a negative Babinski’s reflex), as shown below in the left illustration. With a positive Babinski’s reflex, the great toe dorsiflexes and the other toes fan out, as shown in the right illustration.

NORMAL TOE FLEXION

POSITIVE BABINSKI’S REFLEX![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.087.png)![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.088.png)![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.089.png)

- ***Head trauma.*** Unilateral or bilateral Babinski’s reflex may occur as the result of primary corticospinal damage or secondary injury associated with increased intracranial pressure. Hyperactive DTRs and spasticity commonly occur with Babinski’s reflex. The patient may also have weakness and incoordination. Other signs and symptoms vary with the type of head trauma and include headache, vomiting, behavior changes, altered vital signs, and decreased LOC with abnormal pupillary size and response to light.
  - ***Hepatic encephalopathy.*** Babinski’s reflex occurs late in hepatic encephalopathy when the patient slips into a coma. It’s accompanied by hyperactive DTRs and fetor hepaticus.
    - ***Meningitis.*** With meningitis, bilateral Babinski’s reflex commonly follows fever, chills, and malaise and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. As meningitis progresses, it also causes decreased LOC, nuchal rigidity, positive Brudzinski’s and Kernig’s signs, hyperactive DTRs, and opisthotonos. Associated signs and symptoms include irritability, photophobia, diplopia, delirium, and deep stupor that may progress to coma.
- ***Rabies.*** Bilateral Babinski’s reflex — possibly elicited by nonspecific noxious stimuli alone — appears in the excitation phase of rabies. This phase occurs 2 to 10 days after the onset of prodromal signs and symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and irritability (which occur 30 to 40 days after a bite from an infected animal). Rabies is characterized by marked restlessness and extremely painful pharyngeal muscle spasms. Difficulty swallowing causes excessive drooling and hydrophobia in about 50% of affected patients. Seizures and hyperactive DTRs may also occur.
  - ***Spinal cord injury.*** With acute injury, spinal shock temporarily erases all reflexes. As shock resolves, Babinski’s reflex occurs — unilaterally when injury affects only one side of the spinal cord (Brown-Séquard syndrome) and bilaterally when injury affects both sides. Rather than signaling the return of neurologic function, this reflex confirms corticospinal damage. It’s accompanied by hyperactive DTRs, spasticity, and variable or total loss of pain and temperature sensation, proprioception, and motor function. Horner’s syndrome, marked by unilateral ptosis, pupillary constriction, and facial anhidrosis, may occur with lower cervical cord injury.
    - ***Spinal cord tumor.*** With spinal cord tumor, bilateral Babinski’s reflex occurs with variable loss of pain and temperature sensation, proprioception, and motor function. Spasticity, hyperactive DTRs, absent abdominal reflexes, and incontinence are also characteristic. Diffuse pain may occur at the level of the tumor.
      - ***Spinal paralytic poliomyelitis.*** Unilateral or bilateral Babinski’s reflex occurs 5 to 7 days after the onset of fever. It’s accompanied by progressive weakness, paresthesia, muscle tenderness, spasticity, irritability and, later, atrophy. Resistance to neck flexion is characteristic, as are Hoyne’s, Kernig’s, and Brudzinski’s signs.
        - ***Spinal tuberculosis.*** Spinal tuberculosis may produce bilateral Babinski’s reflex accompanied by variable loss of pain and temperature sensation, proprioception, and motor function. It also causes spasticity, hyperactive DTRs, bladder incontinence, and absent abdominal reflexes.
          - ***Stroke.*** Babinski’s reflex varies with the site of the stroke. If it involves the cerebrum, it produces unilateral Babinski’s reflex accompanied by hemiplegia or hemiparesis, unilateral hyperactive DTRs, hemianopsia, and aphasia. If it involves the brain stem, it produces bilateral Babinski’s reflex accompanied by bilateral weakness or paralysis, bilateral hyperactive DTRs, cranial nerve dysfunction, incoordination, and an unsteady gait. Generalized signs and symptoms of stroke include headache, vomiting, fever, disorientation, nuchal rigidity, seizures, and coma.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.090.png) ***Syringomyelia.*** With syringomyelia, bilateral Babinski’s reflex occurs with muscle atrophy and weakness that may progress to paralysis. It’s accompanied by spasticity, ataxia and, occasionally, deep pain. DTRs may be hypoactive or hyperactive. Cranial nerve dysfunction, such as dysphagia and dysarthria, commonly appears late in the disorder.

**Special Considerations**

Babinski’s reflex usually occurs with incoordination, weakness, and spasticity, all of which increase the patient’s risk of injury. To prevent injury, assist the patient with activity and keep his environment free from obstructions.

Diagnostic tests may include a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or spine, angiography or myelography and, possibly, a lumbar puncture to clarify or confirm the cause of Babinski’s reflex. Prepare the patient as necessary.

**Patient Counseling**

Caution the patient about the need to call for assistance when getting out of bed and discuss ways to maintain a safe environment. Instruct the patient in the use of adaptive devices.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Babinski’s reflex occurs normally in infants ages 18 to 24 months, reflecting immaturity of the corticospinal tract. After age 2, Babinski’s reflex is pathologic and may result from hydrocephalus or any of the causes more commonly seen in adults.

**Back Pain**

Back pain affects an estimated 80% of the population; in fact, it’s the second

leading reason — after the common cold — for lost time from work. Although this symptom may herald a spondylogenic disorder, it may also result from a genitourinary, GI, cardiovascular, or neoplastic disorder. Postural imbalance associated with pregnancy may also cause back pain.

The onset, location, and distribution of pain and its response to activity and rest provide important clues about the cause. Pain may be acute or chronic, constant or intermittent. It may remain localized in the back, radiate along the spine or down one or both legs, or be widespread. Pain may be exacerbated by activity — usually bending, stooping, lifting, or exercising — and alleviated by rest, or it may be unaffected by either.

Intrinsic back pain results from muscle spasm, nerve root irritation, fracture, or a combination of these mechanisms. It usually occurs in the lower back, or lumbosacral area. Back pain may also be referred from the abdomen or flank, possibly signaling a life-threatening perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, or a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient reports acute, severe back pain, quickly take his vital signs and then perform a rapid evaluation to rule out life-threatening causes. Ask him when the pain began. Can he relate it to any causes? For example, did the pain occur after eating? After falling on the ice? Have the patient describe the pain. Is it burning, stabbing, throbbing, or aching? Is it constant or intermittent? Does it radiate to the buttocks, legs, or toes? Does he have leg weakness or footdrop? Does the pain seem to originate in the abdomen and radiate to the back? Has he had a pain like this before? What makes it better or worse? Is it affected by activity or rest? Is it worse in the morning or evening? Does it wake him up? Typically, visceral-referred back pain is unaffected by activity and rest. In contrast, spondylogenic-referred back pain worsens with activity and improves with rest. Pain of neoplastic origin is usually relieved by walking and worsens at night.*

*If the patient describes deep lumbar pain unaffected by activity, palpate for a pulsating epigastric mass. If this sign is present, suspect a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm. Withhold food and fluid in anticipation of emergency surgery. Prepare for I.V. fluid replacement and oxygen administration. Monitor the patient’s vital signs and peripheral pulses closely.*

*If the patient describes severe epigastric pain that radiates through the*

*abdomen to the back, assess him for absent bowel sounds and for abdominal rigidity and tenderness. If these occur, suspect a perforated ulcer or acute pancreatitis. Start an I.V. for fluids and drugs, administer oxygen, and insert a nasogastric tube while withholding food.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If life-threatening causes of back pain are ruled out, continue with a complete history and physical examination. Be aware of the patient’s expressions of pain as you do so. Obtain a medical history, including past injuries and illnesses, and a family history. Ask about diet and alcohol intake. Also, take a drug history, including past and present prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs.

Next, perform a thorough physical examination. Observe skin color, especially in the patient’s legs, and palpate skin temperature. Palpate femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and pedal pulses. Ask about unusual sensations in the legs, such as numbness and tingling. Observe the patient’s posture if pain doesn’t prohibit standing. Does he stand erect or tend to lean toward one side? Observe the level of the shoulders and pelvis and the curvature of the back. Ask the patient to bend forward, backward, and from side to side while you palpate for paravertebral muscle spasms. Note rotation of the spine on the trunk. Palpate the dorsolumbar spine for point tenderness. Then, ask the patient to walk — first on his heels and then on his toes — protect him from falling as he does so. Weakness may reflect a muscular disorder or spinal nerve root irritation. Place the patient in a sitting position to evaluate and compare patellar tendon (knee), Achilles tendon, and Babinski’s reflexes. Evaluate the strength of the extensor hallucis longus by asking the patient to hold up his big toe against resistance. Measure leg length and hamstring and quadriceps muscles bilaterally. Note a difference of more than ⅜" (1 cm) in muscle size, especially in the calf.

To reproduce leg and back pain, position the patient in a supine position on the examining table. Grasp his heel and slowly lift his leg. If he feels pain, note its exact location and the angle between the table and his leg when it occurs. Repeat this maneuver with the opposite leg. Pain along the sciatic nerve may indicate disk herniation or sciatica. Also, note the range of motion of the hip and knee.

Palpate the flanks and percuss with the fingertips or perform fist percussion to elicit costovertebral angle tenderness.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Abdominal aortic aneurysm (dissecting).*** Life-threatening dissection of this aneurysm may initially cause low back pain or dull abdominal pain. More commonly, it produces constant upper abdominal pain. A pulsating abdominal mass may be palpated in the epigastrium; after rupture, however, it no longer pulses. Aneurysmal dissection can also cause mottled skin below the waist, absent femoral and pedal pulses, lower blood pressure in the legs than in the arms, mild to moderate tenderness with guarding, and abdominal rigidity. Signs of shock (such as cool, clammy skin) appear if blood loss is significant.
  - ***Ankylosing spondylitis.*** Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressive disorder that causes sacroiliac pain, which radiates up the spine and is aggravated by lateral pressure on the pelvis. The pain is usually most severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity and isn’t relieved by rest. Abnormal rigidity of the lumbar spine with forward flexion is also characteristic. This disorder can cause local tenderness, fatigue, fever, anorexia, weight loss, and occasional iritis.
    - ***Appendicitis.*** Appendicitis is a life-threatening disorder in which a vague and dull discomfort in the epigastric or umbilical region migrates to McBurney’s point in the right lower quadrant. With retrocecal appendicitis, pain may also radiate to the back. The shift in pain is preceded by anorexia and nausea and is accompanied by fever, occasional vomiting, abdominal tenderness (especially over McBurney’s point), and rebound tenderness. Some patients also have painful, urgent urination.
      - ***Cholecystitis.*** Cholecystitis produces severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen that may radiate to the right shoulder, chest, or back. The pain may arise suddenly or may increase gradually over several hours, and patients usually have a history of similar pain after a high-fat meal. Accompanying signs and symptoms include anorexia, fever, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, abdominal rigidity, pallor, and sweating.
        - ***Chordoma.*** A slow-developing malignant tumor, chordoma causes persistent pain in the lower back, sacrum, and coccyx. As the tumor expands, pain may be accompanied by constipation and bowel or bladder incontinence.
  - ***Endometriosis.*** Endometriosis causes deep sacral pain and severe, cramping pain in the lower abdomen. The pain worsens just before or during menstruation and may be aggravated by defecation. It’s accompanied by constipation, abdominal tenderness, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia.
- ***Intervertebral disk rupture.*** Intervertebral disk rupture produces gradual or sudden low back pain with or without leg pain (sciatica). It rarely produces leg pain alone. Pain usually begins in the back and radiates to the buttocks and leg. The pain is exacerbated by activity, coughing, and sneezing and is eased by rest. It’s accompanied by paresthesia (most commonly, numbness or tingling in the lower leg and foot), paravertebral muscle spasm, and decreased reflexes on the affected side. This disorder also affects posture and gait. The patient’s spine is slightly flexed and he leans toward the painful side. He walks slowly and rises from a sitting to a standing position with extreme difficulty.
  - ***Lumbosacral sprain.*** Lumbosacral sprain causes aching, localized pain, and tenderness associated with muscle spasm on lateral motion. The recumbent patient typically flexes his knees and hips to help ease pain. Flexion of the spine intensifies pain, whereas rest helps relieve it. The pain worsens with movement and is relieved by rest.
    - ***Metastatic tumors.*** Metastatic tumors commonly spread to the spine, causing low back pain in at least 25% of patients. Typically, the pain begins abruptly, is accompanied by cramping muscular pain (usually worse at night), and isn’t relieved by rest.
      - ***Myeloma.*** Back pain caused by myeloma, a primary malignant tumor, usually begins abruptly and worsens with exercise. It may be accompanied by arthritic signs and symptoms, such as achiness, joint swelling, and tenderness. Other signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, peripheral paresthesia, and weight loss.
        - ***Pancreatitis (acute).*** Pancreatitis is a life-threatening disorder that usually produces fulminating, continuous upper abdominal pain that may radiate to both flanks and to the back. To relieve this pain, the patient may bend forward, draw his knees to his chest, or move restlessly about. Early associated signs and symptoms include abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, fever, pallor, tachycardia and, in some patients, abdominal guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and hypoactive bowel sounds. A late sign may be jaundice. Occurring as inflammation subsides, Turner’s sign (ecchymosis of the abdomen or flank) or Cullen’s sign (bluish discoloration of skin around the umbilicus and in both flanks) signals hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
  - ***Perforated ulcer.*** In some patients, perforation of a duodenal or gastric ulcer causes sudden, prostrating epigastric pain that may radiate throughout the abdomen and to the back. This life-threatening disorder also causes boardlike abdominal rigidity; tenderness with guarding; generalized rebound tenderness; the absence of bowel sounds; and grunting, shallow respirations. Associated signs include fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
- ***Prostate cancer.*** Chronic aching back pain may be the only symptom of prostate cancer. This disorder may also produce hematuria and decrease the urine stream.
  - ***Pyelonephritis (acute).*** Pyelonephritis produces progressive flank and lower abdominal pain accompanied by back pain or tenderness (especially over the costovertebral angle). Other signs and symptoms include high fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, flank and abdominal tenderness, and urinary frequency and urgency.
    - ***Renal calculi.*** The colicky pain of renal calculi usually results from irritation of the ureteral lining, which increases the frequency and force of peristaltic contractions. The pain travels from the costovertebral angle to the flank, suprapubic region, and external genitalia. Its intensity varies but may become excruciating if calculi travel down a ureter. If calculi are in the renal pelvis and calyces, dull and constant flank pain may occur. Renal calculi also cause nausea, vomiting, urinary urgency (if a calculus lodges near the bladder), hematuria, and agitation due to pain. Pain resolves or significantly decreases after calculi move to the bladder. Encourage the patient to recover the calculi for analysis.
      - ***Rift Valley fever.*** Rift Valley fever is a viral disease generally found in Africa, but in 2000, outbreaks occurred in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It’s transmitted to humans from the bite of an infected mosquito or from exposure to infected animals. Rift Valley fever may present as several different clinical syndromes. Typical signs and symptoms include fever, myalgia, weakness, dizziness, and back pain. A small percentage of patients may develop encephalitis or may progress to hemorrhagic fever that can lead to shock and hemorrhage. Inflammation of the retina may result in some permanent vision loss.
        - ***Sacroiliac strain.*** Sacroiliac strain causes sacroiliac pain that may radiate to the buttock, hip, and lateral aspect of the thigh. The pain is aggravated by weight bearing on the affected extremity and by abduction with resistance of the leg. Associated signs and symptoms include tenderness of the symphysis pubis and a limp or gluteus medius or abductor lurch.
          - ***Smallpox (variola major).*** Worldwide eradication of smallpox was achieved in 1977; the United States and Russia have the only known storage sites of the virus. The virus is considered a potential agent for biological warfare. Initial signs and symptoms include high fever, malaise, prostration, severe headache, backache, and abdominal pain. A maculopapular rash develops on the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx, face, and forearms and then spreads to the trunk and legs. Within 2 days, the rash becomes vesicular and later pustular. The lesions develop at the same time, appear identical, and are more prominent on the face and extremities. The pustules are round, firm, and deeply embedded in the skin. After 8 to 9 days, the pustules form a crust, and later, the scab separates from the skin, leaving a pitted scar. In fatal cases, death results from encephalitis, extensive bleeding, or secondary infection.
- ***Spinal neoplasm (benign).*** Spinal neoplasm typically causes severe, localized back pain and scoliosis.
  - ***Spinal stenosis.*** Resembling a ruptured intervertebral disk, spinal stenosis produces back pain with or without sciatica, which commonly affects both legs. The pain may radiate to the toes and may progress to numbness or weakness unless the patient rests.
    - ***Spondylolisthesis.*** A major structural disorder characterized by forward slippage of one vertebra onto another, spondylolisthesis may be asymptomatic or may cause low back pain, with or without nerve root involvement. Associated symptoms of nerve root involvement include paresthesia, buttock pain, and pain radiating down the leg. Palpation of the lumbar spine may reveal a “step-off” of the spinous process. Flexion of the spine may be limited.
      - ***Transverse process fracture.*** Transverse process fracture causes severe localized back pain with muscle spasm and hematoma.
        - ***Vertebral compression fracture.*** Initially, vertebral compression fracture may be painless. Several weeks later, it causes back pain aggravated by weight bearing and local tenderness. Fracture of a thoracic vertebra may cause referred pain in the lumbar area.
          - ***Vertebral osteomyelitis.*** Initially, vertebral osteomyelitis causes insidious back pain. As it progresses, the pain may become constant, more pronounced at night, and aggravated by spinal movement. Accompanying signs and symptoms include vertebral and hamstring spasms, tenderness of the spinous processes, fever, and malaise.
            - ***Vertebral osteoporosis.*** Vertebral osteoporosis causes chronic, aching back pain that is aggravated by activity and somewhat relieved by rest. Tenderness may also occur.

**Other Causes**

- ***Neurologic tests.*** Lumbar puncture and myelography can produce transient back pain.

**Special Considerations**

Monitor the patient closely if the back pain suggests a life-threatening cause. Be alert for increasing pain, altered neurovascular status in the legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, altered vital signs, sweating, and cyanosis.

Until a tentative diagnosis is made, withhold analgesics, which may mask the symptoms of a life-threatening cause. Also, withhold food and fluids in case surgery is necessary. Make the patient as comfortable as possible by elevating the head of the bed and placing a pillow under his knees. Encourage relaxation techniques such as deep breathing. Prepare the patient for a rectal or pelvic examination. He may also require routine blood tests, urinalysis, a computed tomography scan, appropriate biopsies, and X-rays of the chest, abdomen, and spine.

Fit the patient for a corset or lumbosacral support. Instruct him not to wear this in bed. He may also require heat or cold therapy, a backboard, a convoluted foam mattress, or pelvic traction. Explain these pain-relief measures to the patient. Teach him about alternatives to analgesic drug therapy, such as biofeedback and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

Be aware that back pain is notoriously associated with malingering. Refer the patient to other professionals, such as a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, or a psychologist, if indicated.

**Patient Counseling**

Provide information about the use of anti-inflammatories, analgesics, and alternatives to drug therapy, such as biofeedback and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. Teach relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, and instruct the patient on correct use of corset or lumbosacral support. Discuss lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or correcting posture.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because a child may have difficulty describing back pain, be alert for nonverbal clues, such as wincing or a refusal to walk. Closely observe family dynamics during history taking for clues that suggest child abuse.

Back pain in the child may stem from intervertebral disk inflammation (diskitis), neoplasms, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, and spondylolisthesis. Disk herniation typically doesn’t cause back pain. Scoliosis, a common disorder in adolescents, rarely causes back pain.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Suspect metastatic cancer — especially of the prostate, colon, or breast — in older patients with a recent onset of back pain that usually isn’t relieved by rest and worsens at night.

**Battle’s Sign**

Battle’s sign — ecchymosis over the mastoid process of the temporal bone — is commonly the only outward sign of a basilar skull fracture. In fact, this type of fracture may go undetected even by skull X-rays. If left untreated, it can be fatal because of associated injury to the nearby cranial nerves and brain stem as well as to blood vessels and the meninges.

Appearing behind one or both ears, Battle’s sign is easily overlooked or hidden by the patient’s hair. During emergency care of a trauma victim, it may be overshadowed by imminently life-threatening or more apparent injuries.

A force that’s strong enough to fracture the base of the skull causes Battle’s sign by damaging supporting tissues of the mastoid area and causing seepage of blood from the fracture site to the mastoid. Battle’s sign usually develops 24 to 36 hours after the fracture and may persist for several days to weeks.

**History and Physical Examination**

Perform a complete neurologic examination. Begin with the history. Ask the patient about recent trauma to the head. Did he sustain a severe blow to the head? Was he involved in a motor vehicle accident? Note the patient’s level of consciousness as he responds. Does he respond quickly or slowly? Are his answers appropriate, or does he appear confused?

Check the patient’s vital signs; be alert for widening pulse pressure and bradycardia and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Assess cranial nerve function in nerves II, III, IV, VI, VII, and VIII. Evaluate pupillary size and response to light as well as motor and verbal responses. Relate these data to the Glasgow Coma Scale. Also, note cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the nose or ears. Ask about postnasal drip, which may reflect CSF drainage down the throat. Look for the halo sign — a bloodstain encircled by a yellowish ring

- on bed linens or dressings. To confirm that drainage is CSF, test it with a Dextrostix; CSF is positive for glucose, whereas mucus isn’t. Follow up the neurologic examination with a complete physical examination to detect other injuries associated with basilar skull fracture.

  **Medical Causes**

- ***Basilar skull fracture.*** Battle’s sign may be the only outward sign of basilar skull fracture, or it may be accompanied by periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), conjunctival hemorrhage, nystagmus, ocular deviation, epistaxis, anosmia, a bulging tympanic membrane (from CSF or blood accumulation), visible fracture lines on the external auditory canal, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, facial paralysis, or vertigo.

**Special Considerations**

Expect a patient with a basilar skull fracture to be on bed rest for several days to weeks. Keep him flat to decrease pressure on dural tears and to minimize CSF leakage. Monitor his neurologic status closely. Avoid nasogastric intubation and nasopharyngeal suction, which may cause cerebral infection. Also, caution the patient against blowing his nose, which may worsen a dural tear.

The patient may need skull X-rays and a computed tomography scan to help confirm basilar skull fracture and to evaluate the severity of head injury. Typically, a basilar skull fracture and associated dural tears heal spontaneously within several days to weeks. However, if the patient has a large dural tear, a craniotomy may be necessary to repair the tear with a graft patch.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain what diagnostic tests the patient may need along with what activities he should avoid, and emphasize the importance of bed rest. Explain to the patient (or caregivers) what signs and symptoms to look for and report, such as changes in mental status, loss of consciousness (LOC), or breathing. Tell the patient to take acetaminophen for headaches, discuss the prospect of surgery with the patient, and answer his questions and concerns.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Children who are victims of abuse frequently sustain basilar skull fractures from severe blows to the head. As in adults, Battle’s sign may be the only outward sign of fracture and, perhaps, the only clue to child abuse. If you suspect child abuse, follow facility protocol for reporting the incident.

**Biot’s Respirations[Ataxic respirations]**

A late and ominous sign of neurologic deterioration, Biot’s respirations are characterized by an irregular and unpredictable rate, rhythm, and depth. This rare breathing pattern may appear abruptly and may reflect increased pressure on the medulla coinciding with brain stem compression.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Observe the patient’s breathing pattern for several minutes to avoid confusing Biot’s respirations with other respiratory patterns.* (See Identifying Biot’s Respirations.) *Assess the patient’s respiratory status and prepare to intubate him and provide mechanical ventilation. Next, take his vital signs, noting especially increased systolic pressure.*

**Medical Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.091.png) ***Brain stem compression.*** Biot’s respirations are characteristic in brain stem compression, a neurologic emergency. Rapidly enlarging lesions may cause ataxic respirations and lead to complete respiratory arrest.

**Special Considerations**

Monitor the patient’s vital signs frequently, including oxygen saturation. Elevate

the head of the patient’s bed 30 degrees to help reduce intracranial pressure. Prepare the patient for emergency surgery to relieve pressure on the brain stem. Computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging may confirm the cause of brain stem compression.

**Identifying Biot’s Respirations![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.092.png)**

Biot’s respirations, also known as *ataxic respirations*, have a completely irregular pattern. Shallow and deep breaths occur randomly, with haphazard, irregular pauses. The respiratory rate tends to be slow and may progressively decelerate to apnea.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.093.png)

**Patient Counseling**

Because Biot’s respirations typically reflect a grave prognosis, give the patient’s family information and emotional support.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Biot’s respirations are rarely seen in children.

**Bladder Distention**

Bladder distention — abnormal enlargement of the bladder — results from an inability to excrete urine, which results in its accumulation. Distention can be caused by a mechanical or anatomic obstruction, neuromuscular disorder, or the use of certain drugs. Relatively common in all ages and both sexes, it’s most common in older men with prostate disorders that cause urine retention.

Distention usually develops gradually, but it occasionally has a sudden onset. Gradual distention usually remains asymptomatic until stretching of the bladder produces discomfort. Acute distention produces suprapubic fullness, pressure, and pain. If severe distention isn’t corrected promptly by catheterization or massage, the bladder rises within the abdomen, its walls become thin, and renal function can be impaired.

Bladder distention is aggravated by the intake of caffeine, alcohol, large quantities of fluid, and diuretics. (See *Bladder Distention: Common Causes and Associated Findings*, pages 92 and 93.)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient has severe distention, insert an indwelling urinary catheter to help relieve discomfort and prevent bladder rupture. If more than 700 mL is emptied from the bladder, compressed blood vessels dilate and may make the patient feel faint. Typically, the indwelling urinary catheter is clamped for 30 to 60 minutes to permit vessel compensation.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If distention isn’t severe, begin by reviewing the patient’s voiding patterns. Find out the time and amount of the patient’s last voiding and the amount of fluid consumed since then. Ask if he has difficulty urinating. Does he use Valsalva’s or Credé’s maneuver to initiate urination? Does he urinate with urgency or without warning? Is urination painful or irritating? Ask about the force and continuity of his urine stream and whether he feels that his bladder is empty after voiding.

Explore the patient’s history of urinary tract obstruction or infections; venereal disease; neurologic, intestinal, or pelvic surgery; lower abdominal or urinary tract trauma; and systemic or neurologic disorders. Note his drug history, including his use of over-the-counter drugs.

Take the patient’s vital signs, and percuss and palpate the bladder. (Remember that if the bladder is empty, it can’t be palpated through the abdominal wall.) Inspect the urethral meatus, and measure its diameter. Describe the appearance and amount of any discharge. Finally, test for perineal sensation

and anal sphincter tone; in male patients, digitally examine the prostate gland.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).*** With BPH, bladder distention gradually develops as the prostate enlarges. Occasionally, its onset is acute. Initially, the patient experiences urinary hesitancy, straining, and frequency; reduced force of and the inability to stop the urine stream; nocturia; and postvoiding dribbling. As the disorder progresses, it produces prostate enlargement, sensations of suprapubic fullness and incomplete bladder emptying, perineal pain, constipation, and hematuria.
  - ***Bladder calculi.*** Bladder calculi may produce bladder distention but more commonly produce pain as the only symptom. The pain is usually referred to the tip of the penis, the vulvar area, the lower back, or the heel. It worsens during walking or exercise and abates when the patient lies down. It can be accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency, terminal hematuria, and dysuria. Pain is usually most severe when micturition ceases.
    - ***Bladder cancer.*** By blocking the urethral orifice, neoplasms can cause bladder distention. Associated signs and symptoms include hematuria (most common sign); urinary frequency and urgency; nocturia; dysuria; pyuria; pain in the bladder, rectum, pelvis, flank, back, or legs; vomiting; diarrhea; and sleeplessness. A mass may be palpable on bimanual examination.

![ref4] **CULTURAL CUE**

*Bladder cancer is twice as common in Whites as in Blacks. It’s relatively uncommon among Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans.*

- ***Multiple sclerosis.*** With multiple sclerosis, a neuromuscular disorder, urine retention, and bladder distention result from the interruption of upper motor neuron control of the bladder. Associated signs and symptoms include optic neuritis, paresthesia, impaired position and vibratory senses, diplopia, nystagmus, dizziness, abnormal reflexes, dysarthria, muscle weakness, emotional lability, Lhermitte’s sign (transient, electric-like shocks that spread down the body when the head is flexed), Babinski’s sign, and ataxia.
  - ***Prostate cancer.*** Prostate cancer eventually causes bladder distention in

    about 25% of patients. Usual signs and symptoms include dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, weight loss, fatigue, perineal pain, constipation, and induration of the prostate or a rigid, irregular prostate on digital rectal examination. For some patients, urine retention and bladder distention are the only signs.

![ref4] **CULTURAL CUE**

*Prostate cancer is more common in blacks than in other racial or ethnic groups.*

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.095.png) ***Prostatitis.*** With acute prostatitis, bladder distention occurs rapidly along with perineal discomfort and suprapubic fullness. Other signs and symptoms include perineal pain; a tense, boggy, tender, and warm enlarged prostate; decreased libido; impotence; decreased force of the urine stream; dysuria; hematuria; and urinary frequency and urgency. Additional signs and symptoms include fatigue, malaise, myalgia, fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting.

With chronic prostatitis, bladder distention is rare. However, it may be accompanied by sensations of perineal discomfort and suprapubic fullness, prostatic tenderness, decreased libido, urinary frequency and urgency, dysuria, pyuria, hematuria, persistent urethral discharge, ejaculatory pain, and a dull pain radiating to the lower back, buttocks, penis, or perineum.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.098.png)

- ***Spinal neoplasms.*** Disrupting upper neuron control of the bladder, spinal neoplasms cause neurogenic bladder and resultant distention. Associated signs and symptoms include a sense of pelvic fullness, continuous overflow dribbling, back pain that typically mimics sciatica pain, constipation, tender vertebral processes, sensory deficits, and muscle weakness, flaccidity, and atrophy. Signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection (dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, tenesmus, hematuria, and weakness) may also occur.
  - ***Urethral calculi.*** With urethral calculi, urethral obstruction leads to bladder distention. The patient experiences interrupted urine flow. The obstruction causes pain radiating to the penis or vulva and referred to the perineum or rectum. It may also produce a palpable stone and urethral discharge.
    - ***Urethral stricture.*** Urethral stricture results in urine retention and bladder distention with chronic urethral discharge (most common sign), urinary frequency (also common), dysuria, urgency, decreased force and diameter of the urine stream, and pyuria. Urinoma and urosepsis may also develop.

**Other Causes**

- ***Catheterization.*** Using an indwelling urinary catheter can result in urine retention and bladder distention. While the catheter is in place, inadequate drainage due to kinked tubing or an occluded lumen may lead to urine retention. In addition, a misplaced urinary catheter or irritation with catheter removal may cause edema or spasms of the detrusor muscle and the external urethral sphincter, thereby blocking urine outflow.
  - ***Drugs.*** Parasympatholytics, anticholinergics, ganglionic blockers, sedatives, anesthetics, and opiates can produce urine retention and bladder distention.

**Special Considerations**

Monitor the patient’s vital signs and the extent of bladder distention. Encourage the patient to change positions to alleviate discomfort. He may require an analgesic.

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests (such as endoscopy and radiologic studies) to determine the cause of bladder distention. You may need to prepare him for surgery if interventions fail to relieve bladder distention and obstruction prevents catheterization.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient to use Valsalva’s maneuver or Credé’s method to empty the bladder. Explain how to stimulate voiding.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Look for urine retention and bladder distention in infants who fail to void normal amounts. (In the first 48 hours of life, infants excrete about 60 mL of urine; during the next week, they excrete about 300 mL of urine daily.) In males, posterior urethral valves, meatal stenosis, phimosis, spinal cord anomalies, bladder diverticula, and other congenital defects may cause urinary obstruction and resultant bladder distention.

**Blood Pressure Decrease[Hypotension]**

Low blood pressure refers to inadequate intravascular pressure to maintain the oxygen requirements of the body’s tissues. Although commonly linked to shock, this sign may also result from a cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, or metabolic disorder. Hypoperfusion states especially affect the kidneys, brain, and heart and may lead to renal failure, a change in the patient’s level of consciousness (LOC), or myocardial ischemia. Low blood pressure may be drug induced or may accompany diagnostic tests — most commonly those using contrast media. It may stem from stress or change of position — specifically, rising abruptly from a supine or sitting position to a standing position (orthostatic hypotension).

Normal blood pressure varies considerably; what qualifies as low blood pressure for one person may be normal for another. Consequently, every blood pressure reading must be compared against the patient’s baseline. Typically, a reading below 90/60 mm Hg, or a drop of 30 mm Hg from the baseline, is considered low blood pressure.

Low blood pressure can reflect an expanded intravascular space (as in severe infections, allergic reactions, or adrenal insufficiency), reduced intravascular volume (as in dehydration and hemorrhage), or decreased cardiac output (as in impaired cardiac muscle contractility). Because the body’s pressure-regulating mechanisms are complex and interrelated, a combination of these factors usually contributes to low blood pressure.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient’s systolic pressure is less than 80 mm Hg, or 30 mm Hg below his baseline, suspect shock. Quickly evaluate the patient for a decreased LOC. Check his apical pulse for tachycardia and his respirations for tachypnea. Also, inspect the patient for cool, clammy skin. Elevate the patient’s legs above the level of his heart, or place him in Trendelenburg’s position if the bed can be adjusted. Then, start an I.V. line using a large-* *bore needle to replace fluids and blood or to administer drugs. Prepare to administer oxygen with mechanical ventilation, if necessary. Monitor the patient’s intake and output, and insert an indwelling urinary catheter to accurately measure urine output. The patient may also need a central venous line or a pulmonary artery catheter to facilitate monitoring his fluid status. Prepare for cardiac monitoring to evaluate cardiac rhythm. Be ready to insert a nasogastric tube to prevent aspiration in the comatose patient. Throughout emergency interventions, keep the patient’s spinal column immobile until spinal cord trauma is ruled out.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient is conscious, ask him about associated symptoms. For example, does he feel unusually weak or fatigued? Has he had nausea, vomiting, or dark or bloody stools? Is his vision blurred? Is his gait unsteady? Does he have palpitations? Does he have chest or abdominal pain or difficulty breathing? Has he had episodes of dizziness or fainting? Do these episodes occur when he stands up suddenly? If so, take the patient’s blood pressure while he’s lying down, sitting, and then standing; compare readings. (See *Ensuring Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement,* page 96.) A drop in systolic or diastolic pressure of 10 to 20 mm Hg or more and an increase in heart rate of more than 15 beats/minute between position changes suggest orthostatic hypotension.

Next, continue with a physical examination. Inspect the skin for pallor, sweating, and clamminess. Palpate peripheral pulses. Note paradoxical pulse — an accentuated fall in systolic pressure during inspiration — which suggests pericardial tamponade. Then, auscultate for abnormal heart sounds (gallops, murmurs), rate (bradycardia, tachycardia), or rhythm. Auscultate the lungs for abnormal breath sounds (diminished sounds, crackles, wheezing), rate (bradypnea, tachypnea), or rhythm (agonal or Cheyne-Stokes respirations). Look for signs of hemorrhage, including visible bleeding and palpable masses, bruising, and tenderness. Assess the patient for abdominal rigidity and rebound tenderness; auscultate for abnormal bowel sounds. Also, carefully assess the patient for possible sources of infection such as open wounds.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Acute adrenal insufficiency.*** Orthostatic hypotension is characteristic with acute adrenal insufficiency, accompanied by fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, fever, and tachycardia. The patient may also have hyperpigmentation of fingers, nails, nipples, scars, and body folds; pale, cool, clammy skin; restlessness; decreased urine output; tachypnea; and coma.
- ***Alcohol toxicity.*** Low blood pressure occurs infrequently; more commonly, alcohol toxicity produces distinct alcohol breath odor, tachycardia, bradypnea, hypothermia, a decreased LOC, seizures, a staggering gait, nausea, vomiting, diuresis, and slow, stertorous breathing.

**Pressure Measurement**

When taking the patient’s blood pressure, begin by applying the cuff properly, as shown here.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.100.png)

Then, be alert for these common pitfalls to avoid recording an inaccurate blood pressure measurement.

*Wrong-sized cuff.* Select the appropriate-sized cuff for the patient. This ensures that adequate pressure is applied to compress the brachial artery during cuff inflation. If the cuff bladder is too narrow, a false- high reading will be obtained; too wide, a false-low reading. The cuff bladder width should be about 40% of the circumference of the midpoint of the limb; bladder length should be twice the width. If the arm circumference is less than 13” (33 cm), select a regular-sized cuff; if it’s between 13” and 16” (33 to 40.5 cm), a large-sized cuff; if it’s more than 16”, a thigh cuff. Pediatric cuffs are also available.

*Slow cuff deflation, causing venous congestion in the extremity.* Don’t deflate the cuff more slowly than 2 mm Hg/heartbeat because you’ll

get a false-high reading.![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.101.png)

*Cuff wrapped too loosely, reducing its effective width.* Tighten the cuff to avoid a false-high reading.

*Mercury column not read at eye level.* Read the mercury column at eye level. If the column is below eye level, you may record a false-low reading; if it’s above eye level, a false-high reading.

*Tilted mercury column.* Keep the mercury column vertical to avoid a false-high reading.

*Poorly timed measurement*. Don’t take the patient’s blood pressure if he appears anxious or has just eaten or ambulated; you’ll get a false- high reading.

*Incorrect position of the arm.* Keep the patient’s arm level with his heart to avoid a false-low reading.

*Cuff overinflation, causing venospasm or pain.* Don’t overinflate the cuff because you’ll get a false-high reading.

*Failure to notice an auscultatory gap* (sound fades out for 10 to 15 mm Hg, then returns). To avoid missing the top Korotkoff sound, estimate systolic pressure by palpation first. Then, inflate the cuff rapidly — at a rate of 2 to 3 mm Hg/second — to about 30 mm Hg above the palpable systolic pressure.

*Inaudibility of feeble sounds.* Before reinflating the cuff, have the patient raise his arm to reduce venous pressure and amplify low- volume sounds. After inflating the cuff, lower the patient’s arm; then, deflate the cuff and listen. Alternatively, with the patient’s arm positioned at heart level, inflate the cuff and have the patient make a fist. Have him rapidly open and close his hand 10 times before you begin to deflate the cuff, and then listen. Make sure to document that the blood pressure reading was augmented.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.102.png) ***Anaphylactic shock.*** Following exposure to an allergen, such as penicillin or insect venom, a dramatic fall in blood pressure and narrowed pulse pressure signal anaphylactic reaction. Initially, anaphylactic shock causes anxiety, restlessness, a feeling of doom, intense itching (especially of the hands and feet), and pounding headache. Later, it may also produce weakness, sweating, nasal congestion, coughing, difficulty breathing, nausea, abdominal cramps, involuntary defecation, seizures, flushing, change or loss of voice due to laryngeal edema, urinary incontinence, and

tachycardia.

- ***Anthrax (inhalation).*** Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that’s caused by the gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium *Bacillus anthracis.* Although the disease most commonly occurs in wild and domestic grazing animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, the spores can live in the soil for many years. The disease can occur in humans exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals, or biological warfare. Most natural cases occur in agricultural regions worldwide. Anthrax may occur in the cutaneous, inhalation, or GI form. Inhalation anthrax is caused by inhalation of aerosolized spores. Initial signs and symptoms are flulike and include fever, chills, weakness, cough, and chest pain. The disease generally occurs in two stages with a period of recovery after the initial signs and symptoms. The second stage develops abruptly with rapid deterioration marked by fever, dyspnea, stridor, and hypotension, generally leading to death within 24 hours. Radiologic findings include mediastinitis and symmetric mediastinal widening.
  - ***Cardiac arrhythmias.*** With an arrhythmia, blood pressure may fluctuate between normal and low readings. Dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, light-headedness, weakness, fatigue, and palpitations may also occur. Auscultation typically reveals an irregular rhythm and a pulse rate greater than 100 beats/minute or less than 60 beats/minute.
    - ***Cardiac contusion.*** With cardiac contusion, low blood pressure occurs along with tachycardia and, at times, anginal pain and dyspnea.
      - ***Cardiac tamponade.*** An accentuated fall in systolic pressure (more than 10 mm Hg) during inspiration, known as *paradoxical pulse*, is characteristic in patients with cardiac tamponade. This disorder also causes restlessness, cyanosis, tachycardia, jugular vein distention, muffled heart sounds, dyspnea, and Kussmaul’s sign (increased venous distention with inspiration).
        - ***Cardiogenic shock.*** A fall in systolic pressure to less than 80 mm Hg or to 30 mm Hg less than the patient’s baseline because of decreased cardiac contractility is characteristic in patients with cardiogenic shock. Accompanying low blood pressure are tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, diminished Korotkoff sounds, peripheral cyanosis, and pale, cool, clammy skin. Cardiogenic shock also causes restlessness and anxiety, which may progress to disorientation and confusion. Associated signs and symptoms include angina, dyspnea, jugular vein distention, oliguria, ventricular gallop, tachypnea, and a weak, rapid pulse.
          - ***Cholera.*** This acute infection, caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*,

            may be mild with uncomplicated diarrhea or severe and life threatening. Cholera is spread by ingesting contaminated water or food, especially shellfish. Signs include abrupt watery diarrhea and vomiting. Severe fluid and electrolyte loss leads to thirst, weakness, muscle cramps, decreased skin turgor, oliguria, tachycardia, and hypotension. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.

- ***Diabetic ketoacidosis.*** Hypovolemia triggered by osmotic diuresis in hyperglycemia is responsible for the low blood pressure associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, which is usually present in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It also commonly produces polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, dehydration, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, breath with fruity odor, Kussmaul’s respirations, tachycardia, seizures, confusion, and stupor that may progress to coma.
  - ***Heart failure.*** With heart failure, blood pressure may fluctuate between normal and low readings. However, a precipitous drop in blood pressure may signal cardiogenic shock. Other signs and symptoms of heart failure include exertional dyspnea, dyspnea of abrupt or gradual onset, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or difficulty breathing in the supine position (orthopnea), fatigue, weight gain, pallor or cyanosis, sweating, and anxiety. Auscultation reveals ventricular gallop, tachycardia, bilateral crackles, and tachypnea. Dependent edema, jugular vein distention, increased capillary refill time, and hepatomegaly may also occur.
    - ***Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).*** HHNS, which is common in the patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, decreases blood pressure — at times dramatically — if he loses significant fluid from diuresis due to severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. It also produces dry mouth, poor skin turgor, tachycardia, confusion progressing to coma, and, occasionally, generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
      - ***Hypovolemic shock.*** A fall in systolic pressure to less than 80 mm Hg or 30 mm Hg less than the patient’s baseline, secondary to acute blood loss or dehydration, is characteristic in hypovolemic shock. Accompanying it are diminished Korotkoff sounds, a narrowed pulse pressure, and a rapid, weak, and irregular pulse. Peripheral vasoconstriction causes cyanosis of the extremities and pale, cool, clammy skin. Other signs and symptoms include oliguria, confusion, disorientation, restlessness, and anxiety.
        - ***Hypoxemia.*** Initially, blood pressure may be normal or slightly elevated, but as hypoxemia becomes more pronounced, blood pressure drops. The patient may also display tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, and confusion and may progress from stupor to coma.

- ***Myocardial infarction (MI).*** With MI, a life-threatening disorder, blood pressure may be low or high. However, a precipitous drop in blood pressure may signal cardiogenic shock. Associated signs and symptoms include chest pain that may radiate to the jaw, shoulder, arm, or epigastrium; dyspnea; anxiety; nausea or vomiting; sweating; and cool, pale, or cyanotic skin. Auscultation may reveal an atrial gallop, a murmur and, occasionally, an irregular pulse.
  - ***Neurogenic shock***. The result of sympathetic denervation due to cervical injury or anesthesia, neurogenic shock produces low blood pressure and bradycardia. However, the patient’s skin remains warm and dry because of cutaneous vasodilation and sweat gland denervation. Depending on the cause of shock, there may also be motor weakness of the limbs or diaphragm.
    - ***Pulmonary embolism.*** Pulmonary embolism causes sudden, sharp chest pain and dyspnea accompanied by a cough and, occasionally, a low-grade fever. Low blood pressure occurs with a narrowed pulse pressure and diminished Korotkoff sounds. Associated signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, a paradoxical pulse, jugular vein distention, and hemoptysis.
      - ***Septic shock.*** Initially, septic shock produces fever and chills. Low blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea may also develop early, but the patient’s skin remains warm. Later, low blood pressure becomes increasingly severe — less than 80 mm Hg or 30 mm Hg less than the patient’s baseline — and is accompanied by narrowed pulse pressure. Other late signs and symptoms include pale skin, cyanotic extremities, apprehension, thirst, oliguria, and coma.
- ***Vasovagal syncope.*** Vasovagal syncope is the transient loss or near loss of consciousness following stressful, painful, or claustrophobic experiences. It’s characterized by low blood pressure, pallor, cold sweats, nausea, palpitations or slowed heart rate, and weakness.

**Other Causes**

- ***Diagnostic tests.*** Diagnostic tests include the gastric acid stimulation test using histamine and X-ray studies using contrast media. The latter may trigger an allergic reaction, which causes low blood pressure.
  - ***Drugs.*** Calcium channel blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, alpha-and beta- adrenergic blockers, general anesthetics, opioid analgesics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, anxiolytics (such as benzodiazepines), tranquilizers, and

most I.V. antiarrhythmics (especially bretylium tosylate) can cause low blood pressure.

**Special Considerations**

Check the patient’s vital signs frequently to determine if low blood pressure is constant or intermittent. If blood pressure is extremely low, an arterial catheter may be inserted to allow close monitoring of pressures. Alternatively, a Doppler flowmeter may be used.

**Normal Pediatric Blood Pressure![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.103.png)![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.104.png)**

If the patient is symptomatic, place him on bed rest and keep the side rails of the bed up. If the patient is asymptomatic and ambulatory, assist him as necessary. To avoid falls, don’t leave a hypotensive patient unattended when he’s sitting or walking.

Prepare the patient for laboratory tests, which may include urinalysis, routine blood studies, an electrocardiogram, and chest, cervical, and abdominal X-rays.

**Patient Counseling**

Advise the patient with orthostatic hypotension to stand up slowly from a sitting or lying position, and emphasize the importance of dangling the feet and rising slowly when getting out of bed. For patients with vasovagal syncope, discuss how to avoid triggers. Also, discuss the need for a cane or a walker.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Normal blood pressure in children is lower than that in adults. (See *Normal Pediatric Blood Pressure*.)

Because accidents occur frequently in children, suspect trauma or shock first as a possible cause of low blood pressure. Remember that low blood pressure typically doesn’t accompany head injury in adults because intracranial hemorrhage is insufficient to cause hypovolemia. However, it does accompany head injury in infants and young children; their expandable cranial vaults allow significant blood loss into the cranial space, resulting in hypovolemia.

Another common cause of low blood pressure in children is dehydration, which results from failure to thrive or from persistent diarrhea and vomiting for as little as 24 hours.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In elderly patients, low blood pressure commonly results from the use of multiple drugs with this potential adverse effect, a problem that needs to be addressed. Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction is another common cause.

**Blood Pressure Increase[Hypertension]**

Elevated blood pressure — an intermittent or sustained increase in blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mm Hg — strikes more men than women and twice as many Blacks as Whites. By itself, this common sign is easily ignored by the patient; after all, he can’t see or feel it. However, its causes can be life threatening.

![ref3] **GENDER CUE**

*Hypertension has been reported to be two to three times more common in women taking hormonal contraceptives than those not taking them. Women*


*age 35 and older who smoke cigarettes should be strongly encouraged to stop; if they continue to smoke, they should be discouraged from using hormonal contraceptives.*

Elevated blood pressure may develop suddenly or gradually. A sudden, severe rise in pressure (exceeding 180/110 mm Hg) may indicate life-threatening hypertensive crisis. However, even a less dramatic rise may be equally significant if it heralds a dissecting aortic aneurysm, increased intracranial pressure, myocardial infarction, eclampsia, or thyrotoxicosis.

Usually associated with essential hypertension, elevated blood pressure may also result from a renal or endocrine disorder; a treatment that affects fluid status, such as dialysis; or a drug’s adverse effect. Ingestion of large amounts of certain foods, such as black licorice and cheddar cheese, may temporarily elevate blood pressure. (See *Pathophysiology of Elevated Blood Pressure*.)

Sometimes, elevated blood pressure may simply reflect inaccurate blood pressure measurement. (See *Ensuring Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement*, page 96.) However, careful measurement alone doesn’t ensure a clinically useful reading. To be useful, each blood pressure reading must be compared with the patient’s baseline. Also, serial readings may be necessary to establish elevated blood pressure.

**Pathophysiology of Elevated Blood Pressure![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.105.png)**

Blood pressure — the force blood exerts on vessels as it flows through them — depends on cardiac output, peripheral resistance, and blood volume. A brief review of its regulating mechanisms — nervous system control, capillary fluid shifts, kidney excretion, and hormonal changes — will help you understand how elevated blood pressure develops.

*Nervous system control* involves the sympathetic system, chiefly baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, which promotes moderate vasoconstriction to maintain normal blood pressure. When this system responds inappropriately, increased vasoconstriction enhances peripheral resistance, resulting in elevated blood pressure.

*Capillary fluid shifts* regulate blood volume by responding to arterial pressure. Increased pressure forces fluid into the interstitial space; decreased pressure allows it to be drawn back into the arteries by osmosis. However, this fluid shift may take several hours to adjust

blood pressure.![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.106.png)

*Kidney excretion* also helps regulate blood volume by increasing or decreasing urine formation. Normally, an arterial pressure of about 60 mm Hg maintains urine output. When pressure drops below this reading, urine formation ceases, thereby increasing blood volume. Conversely, when arterial pressure exceeds this reading, urine formation increases, thereby reducing blood volume. Like capillary fluid shifts, this mechanism may take several hours to adjust blood pressure.

*Hormonal changes* reflect stimulation of the kidney’s renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system in response to low arterial pressure. This system affects vasoconstriction, which increases arterial pressure, and stimulates aldosterone release, which regulates sodium retention

- a key determinant of blood volume.

Elevated blood pressure signals the breakdown or inappropriate response of these pressure-regulating mechanisms. Its associated signs and symptoms concentrate in the target organs and tissues illustrated below.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.107.png)

**History and Physical Examination**

If you detect sharply elevated blood pressure, quickly rule out possible life- threatening causes. (See *Managing Elevated Blood Pressure*.)

After ruling out life-threatening causes, complete a more leisurely history and physical examination. Determine if the patient has a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or renal disease. Ask about a family history of high blood pressure — a likely finding with essential hypertension, pheochromocytoma, or polycystic kidney disease. Then, ask about its onset. Did high blood pressure appear abruptly? Ask the patient’s age. The sudden onset of high blood pressure in middle-aged or elderly patients suggests renovascular stenosis. Although essential hypertension may begin in childhood, it typically isn’t diagnosed until near age 35. Pheochromocytoma and primary aldosteronism usually occur between ages 40 and 60. If you suspect either, check for orthostatic hypotension. Take the patient’s blood pressure with him lying down, sitting, and then standing. Normally, systolic pressure falls and diastolic pressure rises on standing. With orthostatic hypotension, both pressures fall.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS Managing![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.108.png)**

**Elevated Blood Pressure**

Elevated blood pressure can signal various life-threatening disorders. However, if pressure exceeds 180/110 mm Hg, the patient may be experiencing hypertensive crisis and may require prompt treatment. Maintain a patent airway in case the patient vomits, and institute seizure precautions. Prepare to administer an I.V. antihypertensive and diuretic. You’ll also need to insert an indwelling urinary catheter to accurately monitor urine output.

If blood pressure is less severely elevated, continue to rule out other life-threatening causes. If the patient is pregnant, suspect preeclampsia or eclampsia. Place her on bed rest, and insert an I.V. line. Administer magnesium sulfate (to decrease neuromuscular irritability) and an antihypertensive. Monitor her vital signs closely for the next 24 hours. If diastolic blood pressure continues to exceed 100 mm Hg despite drug therapy, you may need to prepare the patient for induced labor and delivery or for cesarean birth. Offer emotional support if she must face delivery of a premature neonate.

If the patient isn’t pregnant, quickly observe for equally obvious clues. Assess![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.109.png) the patient for exophthalmos and an enlarged thyroid gland. If these signs are present, ask about a history of hyperthyroidism. Then, look for other associated signs and symptoms, including tachycardia, widened pulse pressure, palpitations, severe weakness, diarrhea, fever exceeding 100°F (37.8°C), and nervousness. Prepare to administer an antithyroid drug orally or by nasogastric tube, if necessary. Also, evaluate fluid status; look for signs of dehydration such as poor skin turgor. Prepare the patient for I.V. fluid replacement and temperature control using a cooling blanket, if necessary.

If the patient shows signs of increased intracranial pressure (such as a decreased level of consciousness and fixed or dilated pupils), ask him or a family member if he has recently experienced head trauma. Then, check for an increased respiratory rate and bradycardia. You’ll need to maintain a patent airway in case the patient vomits. In addition, institute seizure precautions, and prepare to give an I.V. diuretic. Insert an indwelling urinary catheter, and monitor intake and output. Check his vital signs every 15 minutes until he’s stable.

If the patient has absent or weak peripheral pulses, ask about chest pressure or pain, which suggests a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Enforce bed rest until a diagnosis has been established. As appropriate, give the patient an I.V. antihypertensive or prepare him for surgery.

Note headache, palpitations, blurred vision, and sweating. Ask about wine- colored urine and decreased urine output; these signs suggest glomerulonephritis, which can cause elevated blood pressure.

Obtain a drug history, including past and present prescriptions, herbal preparations, and over-the-counter drugs (especially decongestants). If the patient is already taking an antihypertensive, determine how well he complies with the regimen. Ask about his perception of elevated blood pressure. How serious does he believe it is? Does he expect drug therapy to help? Explore psychosocial or environmental factors that may impact blood pressure control.

Follow up the history with a thorough physical examination. Using a funduscope, check for intraocular hemorrhage, exudate, and papilledema, which characterize severe hypertension. Perform a thorough cardiovascular assessment. Check for carotid bruits and jugular vein distention. Assess skin color, temperature, and turgor. Palpate peripheral pulses. Auscultate for abnormal heart sounds (gallops, louder second sound, murmurs), rate (bradycardia, tachycardia), or rhythm. Then, auscultate for abnormal breath sounds (crackles, wheezing), rate (bradypnea, tachypnea), or rhythm.

Palpate the abdomen for tenderness, masses, or liver enlargement. Auscultate for abdominal bruits. Renal artery stenosis produces bruits over the upper abdomen or in the costovertebral angles. Easily palpable, enlarged kidneys and a large, tender liver suggest polycystic kidney disease. Obtain a urine sample to check for microscopic hematuria.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Anemia.*** Accompanying elevated systolic pressure in anemia are pulsations in the capillary beds, bounding pulse, tachycardia, systolic ejection murmur, pale mucous membranes and, in patients with sickle cell anemia, ventricular gallop and crackles.
  - ***Aortic aneurysm (dissecting).*** Initially, this life-threatening disorder causes a sudden rise in systolic pressure (which may be the precipitating event), but no change in diastolic pressure. However, this increase is brief. The body’s ability to compensate fails, resulting in hypotension. Other signs and symptoms vary, depending on the type of aortic aneurysm. An abdominal aneurysm may cause persistent abdominal and back pain, weakness, sweating, tachycardia, dyspnea, a pulsating abdominal mass, restlessness, confusion, and cool, clammy skin. A thoracic aneurysm may cause a ripping or tearing sensation in the chest, which may radiate to the neck, shoulders, lower back, or abdomen; pallor; syncope; blindness; loss of consciousness; sweating; dyspnea; tachycardia; cyanosis; leg weakness; murmur; and absent radial and femoral pulses.
    - ***Atherosclerosis.*** With atherosclerosis, systolic pressure rises while diastolic pressure commonly remains normal or slightly elevated. The patient may show no other signs, or he may have a weak pulse, flushed skin, tachycardia, angina, and claudication.
      - ***Cushing’s syndrome.*** Twice as common in females as in males, Cushing’s syndrome causes elevated blood pressure and widened pulse pressure as well as truncal obesity, moon face, and other cushingoid signs. It’s usually caused by corticosteroid use.
        - ***Hypertension.*** Essential hypertension develops insidiously and is characterized by a gradual increase in blood pressure from decade to decade. Except for this high blood pressure, the patient may be asymptomatic or (rarely) may complain of suboccipital headache, light- headedness, tinnitus, and fatigue.

          With malignant hypertension, diastolic pressure abruptly rises above 120 mm Hg, and systolic pressure may exceed 200 mm Hg. Typically, the patient has pulmonary edema marked by jugular vein distention, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and coughing of pink, frothy sputum. Other characteristic signs and symptoms include severe headache, confusion, blurred vision, tinnitus, epistaxis, muscle twitching, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.

- ***Increased intracranial pressure (ICP).*** Increased ICP causes an increased respiratory rate initially, followed by increased systolic pressure and widened pulse pressure. Increased ICP affects the heart rate last, causing bradycardia (Cushing’s reflex). Associated signs and symptoms include headache, projectile vomiting, a decreased level of consciousness, and fixed or dilated pupils.
  - ***Metabolic syndrome***. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), a blood pressure equal to or greater than 135/85 mm Hg is symptomatic of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome refers to a group of conditions: increased blood pressure, elevated glucose and insulin levels, excess body fat around the waist, or abnormal cholesterol levels that put the patient at a higher risk for developing heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Having any combination of these puts the patient at an even higher risk. It’s estimated that more than 50 million Americans have metabolic syndrome. Adapting a healthier lifestyle, incorporating better eating habits, losing weight, and increasing physical activity are ways to decrease or delay the risks associated with metabolic syndrome.
    - ***Myocardial infarction (MI).*** MI is a life-threatening disorder that may cause high or low blood pressure. Common findings include crushing chest pain that may radiate to the jaw, shoulder, arm, or epigastrium. Other findings include dyspnea, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis, atrial gallop, and murmurs.
      - ***Pheochromocytoma.*** Paroxysmal or sustained elevated blood pressure characterizes pheochromocytoma and may be accompanied by orthostatic hypotension. Associated signs and symptoms include anxiety, diaphoresis, palpitations, tremors, pallor, nausea, weight loss, and headache.
        - ***Polycystic kidney disease.*** Elevated blood pressure is typically preceded by flank pain. Other signs and symptoms include enlarged kidneys; an enlarged, tender liver; and intermittent gross hematuria.
          - ***Preeclampsia and eclampsia.*** Potentially life threatening to the mother and fetus, preeclampsia and eclampsia characteristically increase blood pressure. They’re defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or more in the first trimester, a reading of 130/80 mm Hg or more in the second or third trimester, an increase of 30 mm Hg above the patient’s baseline systolic pressure, or an increase of 15 mm Hg above the patient’s baseline diastolic pressure. Accompanying elevated blood pressure are generalized edema, sudden weight gain of 3 lb (1.4 kg) or more per week during the second or third trimester, severe frontal headache, blurred or double vision, decreased urine output, proteinuria, midabdominal pain, neuromuscular irritability, nausea, and possibly seizures (eclampsia).
- ***Renovascular stenosis.*** Renovascular stenosis produces abruptly elevated systolic and diastolic pressures. Other characteristic signs and symptoms include bruits over the upper abdomen or in the costovertebral angles, hematuria, and acute flank pain.
  - ***Thyrotoxicosis.*** Accompanying the elevated systolic pressure associated with thyrotoxicosis, a potentially life-threatening disorder, are widened pulse pressure, tachycardia, bounding pulse, pulsations in the capillary nail beds, palpitations, weight loss, exophthalmos, an enlarged thyroid gland, weakness, diarrhea, a fever over 100°F (37.8°C), and warm, moist skin. The patient may appear nervous and emotionally unstable, displaying occasional outbursts or even psychotic behavior. Heat intolerance, exertional dyspnea and, in females, decreased or absent menses may also occur.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Central nervous system stimulants (such as amphetamines), sympathomimetics, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and over-the- counter cold remedies can increase blood pressure, as can cocaine abuse.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.110.png) **HERB ALERT**

*Ginseng and licorice may cause high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat. St. John’s wort can also raise blood pressure, especially when taken with substances that antagonize hypericin, such as amphetamines, cold and hay fever medications, nasal decongestants, pickled foods, beer, coffee, wine, and chocolate.*

- ***Treatments.*** Kidney dialysis and transplantation cause transient elevated

  blood pressure.

**Special Considerations**

If routine screening detects elevated blood pressure, stress to the patient the need for follow-up diagnostic tests. Then, prepare him for routine blood tests and urinalysis. Depending on the suspected cause of the increased blood pressure, radiographic studies, especially of the kidneys, may be necessary.

If the patient has essential hypertension, explain the importance of long-term control of elevated blood pressure and the purpose, dosage, schedule, route, and adverse effects of prescribed antihypertensives. Reassure him that there are other drugs he can take if the one he’s taking isn’t effective or causes intolerable adverse reactions. Instruct him not to discontinue medications without contacting the physician. Encourage him to report adverse reactions; the drug dosage or schedule may simply need adjustment.

Be aware that the patient may experience elevated blood pressure only when in the physician’s office (known as *white coat hypertension*). In such cases, 24- hour blood pressure monitoring is indicated to confirm elevated readings in other settings. In addition, other risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as smoking and elevated cholesterol levels, need to be addressed.

**Patient Counseling**

Emphasize the importance of weight loss and exercise. Explain the need for sodium restriction. Discuss stress management and ways to reduce other risk factors for coronary artery disease. Discuss the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring, and explain how to take prescribed antihypertensives correctly. Explain what adverse drug reactions the patient should report, and emphasize the importance of long-term follow-up care.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Normally, blood pressure in children is lower than it is in adults, an essential point to recognize when assessing a patient for elevated blood pressure. (See *Normal Pediatric Blood Pressure*, page 99.)

Elevated blood pressure in children may result from lead or mercury poisoning, essential hypertension, renovascular stenosis, chronic pyelonephritis, coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, glomerulonephritis, adrenogenital syndrome, or neuroblastoma. Treatment typically begins with drug therapy. Surgery may then follow in patients with patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, neuroblastoma, and some cases of renovascular stenosis. Diuretics and antibiotics are used to treat glomerulonephritis and chronic pyelonephritis; hormonal therapy is used to treat adrenogenital syndrome.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Atherosclerosis commonly produces isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients. Treatment is warranted to prevent long-term complications.

**Bowel Sounds, Absent[Silent abdomen]**

Absent bowel sounds refers to an inability to hear any bowel sounds with a stethoscope in any quadrant after listening for at least 5 minutes. Bowel sounds cease when mechanical or vascular obstruction or neurogenic inhibition halts peristalsis. When peristalsis stops, gas from bowel contents and fluid secreted from the intestinal walls accumulate and distend the lumen, leading to life- threatening complications (such as perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis) or hypovolemic shock.

Simple mechanical obstruction, resulting from adhesions, hernia, or tumor, causes loss of fluids and electrolytes and induces dehydration. Vascular obstruction cuts off circulation to the intestinal walls, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and shock. Neurogenic inhibition, affecting innervation of the intestinal wall, may result from infection, bowel distention, or trauma. It may also follow mechanical or vascular obstruction or metabolic derangement such as hypokalemia.

Abrupt cessation of bowel sounds, when accompanied by abdominal pain, rigidity, and distention, signals a life-threatening crisis requiring immediate intervention. Absent bowel sounds following a period of hyperactive sounds are equally ominous and may indicate strangulation of a mechanically obstructed bowel.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS** *If you fail to detect bowel sounds and the patient reports sudden, severe abdominal pain and cramping or exhibits severe abdominal distention, prepare to insert a nasogastric (NG) or intestinal tube to suction lumen contents and decompress the bowel.* (See Are Bowel Sounds Really Absent?) *Administer I.V. fluids and electrolytes to offset dehydration and imbalances caused by the dysfunctioning bowel.*

*Because the patient may require surgery to relieve an obstruction, withhold oral intake. Take the patient’s vital signs, and be alert for signs of shock, such as hypotension, tachycardia, and cool, clammy skin. Measure abdominal girth as a baseline for gauging subsequent changes.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s condition permits, proceed with a brief history. Start with abdominal pain: When did it begin? Has it gotten worse? Where does he feel it? Ask about a sensation of bloating and about flatulence. Find out if the patient has had diarrhea or has passed pencil-thin stools — possible signs of a developing luminal obstruction. The patient may have had no bowel movements at all — a possible sign of complete obstruction or paralytic ileus.

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Are Bowel Sounds Really![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.111.png)**

**Absent?**

Before concluding that the patient has absent bowel sounds, ask yourself these three questions:

*Did you use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to auscultate for the bowel sounds?*

The diaphragm detects high-frequency sounds, such as bowel sounds, whereas the bell detects low-frequency sounds, such as a vascular bruit or venous hum.

*Did you listen in the same spot for at least 5 minutes for the presence of bowel sounds?*

Normally, bowel sounds occur every 5 to 15 seconds, but the duration of a single sound may be less than 1 second.

*Did you listen for bowel sounds in all quadrants?*

Bowel sounds may be absent in one quadrant but present in another.

Ask about conditions that commonly lead to mechanical obstruction, such as abdominal tumors, hernias, and adhesions from past surgery. Determine if the patient was involved in an accident — even a seemingly minor one, such as falling off a stepladder — that may have caused vascular clots. Check for a history of acute pancreatitis, diverticulitis, or gynecologic infection, which may have led to intra-abdominal infection and bowel dysfunction. Be sure to ask about previous toxic conditions, such as uremia, and about spinal cord injury, which can lead to paralytic ileus.

If the patient’s pain isn’t severe or accompanied by other life-threatening signs or symptoms, obtain a detailed medical and surgical history and perform a complete physical examination followed by an abdominal assessment and pelvic examination.

Start your assessment by inspecting the abdominal contour. Stoop at the recumbent patient’s side and then at the foot of his bed to detect localized or generalized distention. Percuss and palpate the abdomen gently. Listen for dullness over fluid-filled areas and tympany over pockets of gas. Palpate for abdominal rigidity and guarding, which suggest peritoneal irritation that can lead to paralytic ileus.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Complete mechanical intestinal obstruction.*** Absent bowel sounds follow a period of hyperactive bowel sounds in this potentially life-threatening disorder. This silence accompanies acute, colicky abdominal pain that arises in the quadrant of obstruction and may radiate to the flank or lumbar regions. Associated signs and symptoms include abdominal distention, bloating, constipation, and nausea and vomiting (the higher the blockage, the earlier and more severe the vomiting). In late stages, signs of shock may occur with fever, rebound tenderness, and abdominal rigidity.
  - ***Mesenteric artery occlusion.*** With mesenteric artery occlusion, a life- threatening disorder, bowel sounds disappear after a brief period of hyperactive sounds. Sudden, severe midepigastric or periumbilical pain occurs next, followed by abdominal distention, bruits, vomiting, constipation, and signs of shock. Fever is common. Abdominal rigidity may appear later.
    - ***Paralytic (adynamic) ileus.*** The cardinal sign is absent bowel sounds. In addition to abdominal distention, associated signs and symptoms of paralytic ileus include generalized discomfort and constipation or the passage of small liquid stools. If paralytic ileus follows acute abdominal

infection, the patient may also experience fever and abdominal pain.

**Other Causes**

- ***Abdominal surgery.*** Bowel sounds are normally absent after abdominal surgery — the result of anesthetic use and surgical manipulation.

**Special Considerations**

After you’ve inserted an NG or intestinal tube, elevate the head of the patient’s bed at least 30 degrees, and turn the patient to facilitate passage of the tube through the GI tract. (Remember not to tape an intestinal tube to the patient’s face.) Ensure tube patency by checking for drainage and properly functioning suction devices, and irrigate accordingly.

Continue to administer I.V. fluids and electrolytes, and make sure that you send a serum specimen to the laboratory for electrolyte analysis at least once per day. The patient may need X-ray studies and further blood work to determine the cause of absent bowel sounds.

After mechanical obstruction and intra-abdominal sepsis have been ruled out as the cause of absent bowel sounds, give the patient drugs to control pain and stimulate peristalsis. Remember that opioids may slow peristalsis.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the need for diagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures, including postoperative ambulation. Also, explain which foods and fluids the patient should avoid.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Absent bowel sounds in children may result from Hirschsprung’s disease or intussusception, both of which can lead to life-threatening obstruction.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Older patients with a bowel obstruction that doesn’t respond to decompression should be considered for early surgical intervention to avoid the risk of bowel infarct.

**Bowel Sounds, Hyperactive**

Sometimes audible without a stethoscope, hyperactive bowel sounds reflect increased intestinal motility (peristalsis). They’re commonly characterized as rapid, rushing, gurgling waves of sounds. (See *Characteristics of Bowel Sounds*.) They may stem from life-threatening bowel obstruction or GI hemorrhage or from GI infection, inflammatory bowel disease (which usually follows a chronic course), food allergies, or stress.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*After detecting hyperactive bowel sounds, quickly check the patient’s vital signs and ask him about associated symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. If he reports cramping abdominal pain or vomiting, continue to auscultate for bowel sounds. If bowel sounds stop abruptly, suspect complete bowel obstruction. Prepare to assist with GI suction and decompression, to give I.V. fluids and electrolytes, and prepare the patient for surgery.*

*If he has diarrhea, record its frequency, amount, color, and consistency. If you detect excessive watery diarrhea or bleeding, prepare to administer an antidiarrheal, I.V. fluids and electrolytes, and, possibly, blood transfusions.*

**Characteristics of Bowel Sounds![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.112.png)**

The sounds of swallowed air and fluid moving through the GI tract are known as *bowel sounds.* These sounds usually occur every 5 to 15 seconds, but their frequency may be irregular. For example, bowel sounds are normally more active just before and after a meal. Bowel sounds may last less than 1 second or up to several seconds.

*Normal bowel sounds* can be characterized as murmuring, gurgling, or tinkling. *Hyperactive bowel sounds* can be characterized as loud, gurgling, splashing, and rushing; they’re higher pitched and occur more frequently


than normal sounds. *Hypoactive bowel sounds* can be characterized as softer or lower in tone and less frequent than![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.113.png) normal sounds.

![ref3] **GENDER CUE**

*Homosexual males who report acute diarrhea and who have negative fecal ova and parasite cultures may be infected with chlamydial proctitis not associated with lymphogranuloma venereum. Because rectal cultures will probably be negative, treatment with tetracycline is appropriate.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If you’ve ruled out life-threatening conditions, obtain a detailed medical and surgical history. Ask the patient if he has had a hernia or abdominal surgery because these may cause mechanical intestinal obstruction. Does he have a history of inflammatory bowel disease? Also, ask about recent eruptions of gastroenteritis among family members, friends, or coworkers. If the patient has traveled recently, even within the United States, was he aware of any endemic illnesses?

In addition, determine whether stress may have contributed to the patient’s problem. Ask about food allergies and recent ingestion of unusual foods or fluids. Check for fever, which suggests infection. Having already auscultated, now gently inspect, percuss, and palpate the abdomen.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Crohn’s disease.*** Hyperactive bowel sounds usually arise insidiously. Associated signs and symptoms include diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain that may be relieved by defecation, anorexia, a low-grade fever, abdominal distention and tenderness, and, in many cases, a fixed mass in the right lower quadrant. Perianal and vaginal lesions are common. Muscle wasting, weight loss, and signs of dehydration may occur as Crohn’s disease progresses.
  - ***Food hypersensitivity.*** Malabsorption — typically lactose intolerance — may cause hyperactive bowel sounds. Associated signs and symptoms include diarrhea and, possibly, nausea and vomiting, angioedema, and urticaria.
    - ***Gastroenteritis.*** Hyperactive bowel sounds follow sudden nausea and vomiting and accompany “explosive” diarrhea. Abdominal cramping or

pain is common, usually after a peristaltic wave. Fever may occur, depending on the causative organism.

- ***GI hemorrhage.*** Hyperactive bowel sounds provide the most immediate indication of persistent upper GI bleeding. Other findings include hematemesis, coffee-ground vomitus, abdominal distention, bloody diarrhea, rectal passage of bright-red clots and jelly-like material or melena, and pain during bleeding. Decreased urine output, tachycardia, and hypotension accompany blood loss.
  - ***Mechanical intestinal obstruction.*** Hyperactive bowel sounds occur simultaneously with cramping abdominal pain every few minutes in patients with mechanical intestinal obstruction, a potentially life-threatening disorder; bowel sounds may later become hypoactive and then disappear. With small-bowel obstruction, nausea and vomiting occur earlier and with greater severity than in large-bowel obstruction. With complete bowel obstruction, hyperactive sounds are also accompanied by abdominal distention and constipation, although the part of the bowel distal to the obstruction may continue to empty for up to 3 days.
    - ***Ulcerative colitis (acute).*** Hyperactive bowel sounds arise abruptly in patients with ulcerative colitis and are accompanied by bloody diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, and tenesmus. Weight loss, arthralgias, and arthritis may occur.

**Special Considerations**

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests. These may include endoscopy to view a suspected lesion, barium X-rays, or stool analysis. An increased white blood cell count may indicate an infection.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain which dietary changes are necessary or beneficial and which physical activities the patient should avoid. Discuss stress reduction techniques.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Hyperactive bowel sounds in children usually result from gastroenteritis, erratic eating habits, excessive ingestion of certain foods (such as unripened fruit), or food allergy.

**Bowel Sounds, Hypoactive**

**(See Also Bowel Sounds, Absent)**

Hypoactive bowel sounds, detected by auscultation, are diminished in regularity, tone, and loudness from normal bowel sounds. In themselves, hypoactive bowel sounds don’t herald an emergency; in fact, they’re considered normal during sleep. However, they may portend absent bowel sounds, which can indicate a life-threatening disorder.

Hypoactive bowel sounds result from decreased peristalsis, which, in turn, can result from a developing bowel obstruction. The obstruction may be mechanical (as from a hernia, tumor, or twisting), vascular (as from an embolism or thrombosis), or neurogenic (as from mechanical, ischemic, or toxic impairment of bowel innervation). Hypoactive bowel sounds can also result from the use of certain drugs, abdominal surgery, and radiation therapy.

**History and Physical Examination**

After detecting hypoactive bowel sounds, look for related symptoms. Ask the patient about the location, onset, duration, frequency, and severity of any pain. Cramping or colicky abdominal pain usually indicates a mechanical bowel obstruction, whereas diffuse abdominal pain usually indicates intestinal distention related to paralytic ileus.

Ask the patient about any recent vomiting. When did it begin? How often does it occur? Does the vomitus look bloody? Also, ask about changes in bowel habits. Does he have a history of constipation? When was the last time he had a bowel movement or expelled gas?

Obtain a detailed medical and surgical history of conditions that may cause mechanical bowel obstruction, such as an abdominal tumor or hernia. Does the patient have a history of severe pain; trauma; conditions that can cause paralytic ileus, such as pancreatitis; bowel inflammation or gynecologic infection, which may produce peritonitis; or toxic conditions such as uremia? Has he recently had radiation therapy or abdominal surgery or ingested a drug, such as an opiate, which can decrease peristalsis and cause hypoactive bowel sounds?


After the history is complete, perform a careful physical examination. Inspect the abdomen for distention, noting surgical incisions and obvious masses. Gently percuss and palpate the abdomen for masses, gas, fluid, tenderness, and rigidity. Measure abdominal girth to detect any subsequent increase in distention. Also, check for poor skin turgor, hypotension, narrowed pulse pressure, and other signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which may result from paralytic ileus.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Mechanical intestinal obstruction.*** Bowel sounds may become hypoactive after a period of hyperactivity. The patient may also have acute colicky abdominal pain in the quadrant of obstruction, possibly radiating to the flank or lumbar region; nausea and vomiting (the higher the obstruction, the earlier and more severe the vomiting); constipation; and abdominal distention and bloating. If the obstruction becomes complete, signs of shock may occur.
  - ***Mesenteric artery occlusion.*** After a brief period of hyperactivity, bowel sounds become hypoactive and then quickly disappear, signifying a life- threatening crisis. Associated signs and symptoms include fever; a history of colicky abdominal pain leading to sudden and severe midepigastric or periumbilical pain, followed by abdominal distention and possible bruits; vomiting; constipation; and signs of shock. Abdominal rigidity may appear late.
    - ***Paralytic (adynamic) ileus.*** Bowel sounds are hypoactive and may become absent. Associated signs and symptoms include abdominal distention, generalized discomfort, and constipation or passage of small, liquid stools and flatus. If the disorder follows acute abdominal infection, fever and abdominal pain may occur.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Certain classes of drugs reduce intestinal motility and thus produce hypoactive bowel sounds. These include opiates, such as codeine; anticholinergics, such as propantheline bromide; phenothiazines, such as chlorpromazine; and Vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine. General or spinal anesthetics produce transient hypoactive sounds.
  - ***Radiation therapy.*** Hypoactive bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness may occur after irradiation of the abdomen.
- ***Surgery.*** Hypoactive bowel sounds may occur after manipulation of the bowel. Motility and bowel sounds in the small intestine usually resume within 24 hours; colonic bowel sounds, in 3 to 5 days.

**Special Considerations**

Frequently evaluate the patient with hypoactive bowel sounds for indications of shock (thirst; anxiety; restlessness; tachycardia; cool, clammy skin; weak, thready pulse), which can develop if peristalsis continues to diminish and fluid is lost from the circulation.

Be alert for the sudden absence of bowel sounds, especially in the postoperative patient or a patient with hypokalemia because there’s an increased risk of paralytic ileus. Monitor the patient’s vital signs and auscultate for bowel sounds every 2 to 4 hours.

Severe pain, abdominal rigidity, guarding, and fever, accompanied by hypoactive bowel sounds, may indicate paralytic ileus from peritonitis. If these signs and symptoms occur, prepare for emergency interventions. (See “Bowel Sounds, Absent,” pages 106 to 108.)

The patient with hypoactive bowel sounds may require GI suction and decompression, using a nasogastric or intestinal tube. If so, restrict the patient’s oral intake. Then, elevate the head of the bed at least 30 degrees, and turn the patient to facilitate passage of the tube through the GI tract.

Remember not to tape an intestinal tube to the patient’s face. Ensure tube patency by watching for drainage and properly functioning suction devices. Irrigate the tube, and closely monitor drainage.

Continue to administer I.V. fluids and electrolytes, and send a serum specimen to the laboratory for electrolyte analysis at least once per day. Recognize that the patient may need X-ray studies, endoscopic procedures, and further blood work to determine the cause of hypoactive bowel sounds.

Provide comfort measures as needed. Semi-Fowler’s position offers the best relief for the patient with paralytic ileus. Sometimes, getting the patient to ambulate can reactivate the sluggish bowel. However, if the patient can’t tolerate ambulation, range-of-motion exercises or turning from side to side may stimulate peristalsis. Also, turning the patient from side to side helps move gas through the intestines.

**Patient Counseling**

Tell the caregiver that ambulation or frequent turning are important; tell him to maintain food and fluid restrictions. Teach the patient or caregiver about the

need for diagnostic tests and procedures.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Hypoactive bowel sounds in a child may simply be due to bowel distention from excessive swallowing of air while the child was eating or crying. However, make sure to observe the child for further signs of illness. As with an adult, sluggish bowel sounds in a child may signal the onset of paralytic ileus or peritonitis.

**Bradycardia**

Bradycardia refers to a heart rate of less than 60 beats/minute. It occurs normally in young adults, trained athletes, and elderly people as well as during sleep. It’s also a normal response to vagal stimulation caused by coughing, vomiting, or straining during defecation. When bradycardia results from these causes, the heart rate rarely drops below 40 beats/minute. However, when it results from pathologic causes (such as cardiovascular disorders), the heart rate may be slower.

By itself, bradycardia is a nonspecific sign. However, in conjunction with such symptoms as chest pain, dizziness, syncope, and shortness of breath, it can signal a life-threatening disorder.

**History and Physical Examination**

After detecting bradycardia, check for related signs of life-threatening disorders. (See *Managing Severe Bradycardia*, page 114.) If the patient’s bradycardia isn’t accompanied by untoward signs, ask the patient if he or a family member has a history of a slow pulse rate because this may be inherited. Also, find out if he has an underlying metabolic disorder, such as hypothyroidism, which can precipitate bradycardia. Ask which medications he’s taking and if he’s complying with the prescribed schedule and dosage. Monitor his vital signs, temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Cardiac arrhythmia.*** Depending on the type of arrhythmia and the patient’s tolerance of it, bradycardia may be transient or sustained, benign or life threatening. Related findings include hypotension, palpitations, dizziness, weakness, syncope, and fatigue.
  - ***Cardiomyopathy.*** Cardiomyopathy is a potentially life-threatening disorder that may cause transient or sustained bradycardia. Other findings include dizziness, syncope, edema, fatigue, jugular vein distention, orthopnea, dyspnea, and peripheral cyanosis.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS Managing![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.114.png)**

**Severe Bradycardia**

Bradycardia can signal a life-threatening disorder when accompanied by pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope, or other symptoms, prolonged exposure to cold, or head or neck trauma. In such a patient, quickly take his vital signs. Connect the patient to a cardiac monitor, and insert an I.V. line. Depending on the cause of bradycardia, you’ll need to administer fluids, atropine, or thyroid medication. If indicated, insert an indwelling urinary catheter. Intubation, mechanical ventilation, or placement of a pacemaker may be necessary if the patient’s respiratory rate falls.

If appropriate, perform a focused evaluation to help locate the cause of bradycardia. For example, ask about pain. Viselike pressure or crushing or burning chest pain that radiates to the arms, back, or jaw may indicate an acute myocardial infarction (MI); a severe headache may indicate increased intracranial pressure. Also, ask about nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath — signs and symptoms associated with an acute MI and cardiomyopathy. Observe the patient for peripheral cyanosis, edema, or jugular vein distention, which may indicate cardiomyopathy. Look for a thyroidectomy scar because severe bradycardia may result from hypothyroidism caused by failure to take thyroid hormone replacements.

If the cause of bradycardia is evident, provide supportive care. For example, keep the hypothermic patient warm by applying blankets, and monitor his core temperature until it reaches 99°F (37.2°C); stabilize the head and neck of a trauma patient until cervical spinal injury is ruled out.

- ***Hypothermia.*** Bradycardia usually appears when the core temperature

  drops below 89.6°F (32°C). It’s accompanied by shivering, peripheral cyanosis, muscle rigidity, bradypnea, and confusion leading to stupor.

- ***Hypothyroidism.*** Hypothyroidism causes severe bradycardia in addition to fatigue, constipation, unexplained weight gain, and sensitivity to cold. Related signs include cool, dry, thick skin; sparse, dry hair; facial swelling; periorbital edema; thick, brittle nails; and confusion leading to stupor.
  - ***Myocardial infarction (MI).*** Sinus bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia associated with an acute MI. Accompanying signs and symptoms of an MI include an aching, burning, or viselike pressure in the chest that may radiate to the jaw, shoulder, arm, back, or epigastric area; nausea and vomiting; cool, clammy, and pale or cyanotic skin; anxiety; and dyspnea. Blood pressure may be elevated or depressed. Auscultation may reveal abnormal heart sounds.

**Other Causes**

- ***Diagnostic tests.*** Cardiac catheterization and electrophysiologic studies can induce temporary bradycardia.
  - ***Drugs.*** Beta-adrenergic blockers and some calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, topical miotics (such as pilocarpine), protamine, quinidine and other antiarrhythmics, and sympatholytics may cause transient bradycardia. Failure to take thyroid replacements may cause bradycardia.
    - ***Invasive treatments.*** Suctioning can induce hypoxia and vagal stimulation, causing bradycardia. Cardiac surgery can cause edema or damage to conduction tissues, causing bradycardia.

**Special Considerations**

Continue to monitor the patient’s vital signs frequently. Be especially alert for changes in cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate, and the level of consciousness.

Prepare the patient for laboratory tests, which can include complete blood count; cardiac enzyme, serum electrolyte, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, arterial blood gas, and blood drug levels; thyroid function tests; and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. If appropriate, prepare the patient for 24-hour Holter monitoring.

**Patient Counseling**

Inform the patient about signs and symptoms he should report. Give instructions

for pulse measurement, and explain the parameters for calling the physician and seeking emergency care. If a patient is getting a pacemaker, explain its use.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Heart rates are normally higher in children than in adults. Fetal bradycardia — a heart rate of less than 120 beats/minute — may occur during prolonged labor or complications of delivery, such as compression of the umbilical cord, partial abruptio placentae, and placenta previa. Intermittent bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by apnea, commonly occurs in premature infants. Bradycardia rarely occurs in full-term infants or children. However, it can result from congenital heart defects, acute glomerulonephritis, and transient or complete heart block associated with cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Sinus node dysfunction is the most common bradyarrhythmia encountered among the elderly. Patients with this disorder may have as their chief complaint fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness, or syncope. If patients are asymptomatic, no intervention is necessary. Symptomatic patients, however, require careful scrutiny of their drug therapy. Beta-adrenergic blockers, verapamil, diazepam, sympatholytics, antihypertensives, and some antiarrhythmics have been implicated; symptoms may clear when these drugs are discontinued. Pacing is usually indicated in patients with symptomatic bradycardia lacking a correctable cause.

**Bradypnea**

Commonly preceding life-threatening apnea or respiratory arrest, bradypnea is a pattern of regular respirations with a rate of fewer than 10 breaths/minute. This sign results from neurologic and metabolic disorders and drug overdose, which depress the brain’s respiratory control centers. (See *Understanding How the Nervous System Controls Breathing*, page 116.)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Depending on the degree of central nervous system (CNS) depression, the patient with severe bradypnea may require constant stimulation to breathe. If the patient seems excessively sleepy, try to arouse him by shaking and instructing him to breathe. Quickly take the patient’s vital signs. Assess his neurologic status by checking pupil size and reactions and by evaluating his level of consciousness (LOC) and his ability to move his extremities.*

*Place the patient on an apnea monitor and pulse oximeter, keep emergency airway equipment available, and be prepared to assist with intubation and mechanical ventilation if spontaneous respirations cease. To prevent aspiration, position the patient on his side or keep his head elevated 30 degrees higher than the rest of his body, and clear his airway with suction or finger sweeps, if necessary. Administer opioid antagonists, as ordered.*

**History and Physical Examination**

Obtain a brief history from the patient, if possible. Alternatively, obtain this information from whoever accompanied him to your facility. Ask if he’s experiencing a drug overdose and, if so, try to determine what drugs he took, how much, when, and by what route. Check his arms for needle marks, indicating possible drug abuse. You may need to administer I.V. naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

**Understanding How the Nervous System Controls Breathing![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.115.png)**

Stimulation from external sources and from higher brain centers acts on respiratory centers in the pons and medulla. These centers, in turn, send impulses to the various parts of the respiratory system to alter respiration patterns.


![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.116.png)

If you rule out a drug overdose, ask about chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and renal failure. Check for a medical identification bracelet or an I.D. card that identifies an underlying condition. Also, ask whether the patient has a history of head trauma, brain tumor, neurologic infection, or stroke.

Patients with severe ketoacidosis may experience Kussmaul’s respirations. Associated signs and symptoms include a decreased LOC, fatigue, weakness, a fruity breath odor, and oliguria.

- ***Hepatic failure.*** Occurring with end-stage hepatic failure, bradypnea may be accompanied by coma, hyperactive reflexes, asterixis, a positive Babinski’s sign, fetor hepaticus, and other signs.
  - ***Increased intracranial pressure (ICP).*** A late sign of increased ICP, a life- threatening condition, bradypnea is preceded by a decreased LOC, deteriorating motor function, and fixed, dilated pupils. The triad of bradypnea, bradycardia, and hypertension is a classic sign of late medullary strangulation.
    - ***Renal failure.*** Occurring with end-stage renal failure, bradypnea may be accompanied by convulsions, a decreased LOC, GI bleeding, hypotension or hypertension, uremic frost, and diverse other signs.
      - ***Respiratory failure.*** Bradypnea occurs with end-stage respiratory failure along with cyanosis, diminished breath sounds, tachycardia, mildly increased blood pressure, and a decreased LOC.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Overdose with an opioid analgesic or, less commonly, a sedative, barbiturate, phenothiazine, or other CNS depressant can cause bradypnea. The use of any of these drugs with alcohol can also cause bradypnea.

**Special Considerations**

Because a patient with bradypnea may develop apnea, check his respiratory status frequently and be prepared to give ventilatory support if necessary. Don’t leave the patient unattended, especially if his LOC is decreased. Keep his bed in the lowest position and raise the side rails. Obtain blood for arterial blood gas analysis, electrolyte studies, and a possible drug screen. Ready the patient for chest X-rays and, possibly, a computed tomography scan of the head.

Administer prescribed drugs and oxygen. Avoid giving the patient a CNS depressant because it can exacerbate bradypnea. Similarly, give oxygen judiciously to a patient with chronic carbon dioxide retention, which may occur with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because excess oxygen therapy can decrease respiratory drive.

When dealing with slow breathing in hospitalized patients, always review all drugs and dosages given during the last 24 hours.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the complications of opioid therapy, such as bradypnea, and discuss the

signs and symptoms of opioid toxicity. Teach the patient what causes bradypnea. Also, teach him about the treatment plan after a diagnosis is established.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because respiratory rates are higher in children than in adults, bradypnea in children is defined according to age. (See *Respiratory Rates in Children*.)

**Respiratory Rates in Children![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.118.png)**

This graph shows normal respiratory rates in children, which are higher than normal rates in adults. Accordingly, bradypnea in children is defined by the age of the child.

**Geriatric Pointers**

When drugs are prescribed for older patients, keep in mind that the elderly have

a higher risk of developing bradypnea secondary to drug toxicity. That’s because many of these patients take several drugs that can potentiate this effect and typically have other conditions that predispose them to it. Warn older patients about this potentially life-threatening complication.

**Breast Dimpling**

**(See also Breast nodule, Breast Pain, Breast Ulcer)**

Breast dimpling — the puckering or retraction of skin on the breast — results from abnormal attachment of the skin to underlying tissue. It suggests an inflammatory or malignant mass beneath the skin surface and usually represents a late sign of breast cancer; benign lesions usually don’t produce this effect. Dimpling usually affects women older than age 40, but also occasionally affects men.

Because breast dimpling occurs over a mass or induration, the patient usually discovers other signs before becoming aware of the dimpling. However, a thorough breast examination may reveal dimpling and alert the patient and nurse to a problem.

**History and Physical Examination**

Obtain a medical, reproductive, and family history, noting factors that place the patient at a high risk for breast cancer. Ask about pregnancy history because women who haven’t had a full-term pregnancy before age 30 are at higher risk for developing breast cancer. Has her mother or a sister had breast cancer? Has she herself had a previous malignancy, especially cancer in the other breast? Ask about the patient’s dietary habits because a high-fat diet predisposes women to breast cancer.

Ask the patient if she has noticed changes in the shape of her breast. Is any area painful or tender, and is the pain cyclic? If she’s breast-feeding, has she recently experienced high fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, fatigue, or other flulike signs or symptoms? Can she remember sustaining trauma to the breast?

Carefully inspect the dimpled area. Is it swollen, red, or warm to the touch? Do you see bruises or contusions? Ask the patient to tense her pectoral muscles by pressing her hips with both hands or by raising her hands over her head. Does the puckering increase? Gently pull the skin upward toward the clavicle. Is the dimpling exaggerated?

Observe the breast for nipple retraction. Do both nipples point in the same direction? Are the nipples flattened or inverted? Does the patient report nipple discharge? If so, ask her to describe the color and character of the discharge. Observe the contour of both breasts. Are they symmetrical?

Examine both breasts with the patient lying down, sitting, and then leaning forward. Does the skin move freely over both breasts? If you can palpate a lump, describe its size, location, consistency, mobility, and delineation. What relation does the lump have to the breast dimpling? Gently mold the breast skin around the lump. Is the dimpling exaggerated? Also, examine breast and axillary lymph nodes, noting any enlargement.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Breast abscess.*** Breast dimpling sometimes accompanies a chronic breast abscess. Associated findings include a firm, irregular, nontender lump and signs of nipple retraction, such as deviation, inversion, or flattening. Axillary lymph nodes may be enlarged.
  - ***Breast cancer.*** Breast dimpling is an important, but somewhat late sign of breast cancer. A neoplasm that causes dimpling is usually close to the skin and at least 1 cm in diameter. It feels irregularly shaped and fixed to underlying tissue, and it’s usually painless. Other signs of breast cancer include peau d’orange, changes in breast symmetry or size, nipple retraction, and a unilateral, spontaneous, nonmilky nipple discharge that’s serous or bloody. (A bloody nipple discharge in the presence of a lump is a classic sign of breast cancer.) Axillary lymph nodes may be enlarged. Pain may be present but isn’t a reliable symptom of breast cancer. A breast ulcer may appear as a late sign.
    - ***Fat necrosis.*** Breast dimpling from fat necrosis follows inflammation and trauma to the fatty tissue of the breast (although the patient usually can’t remember such trauma). Tenderness, erythema, bruising, and contusions may occur. Other findings include a hard, indurated, poorly delineated lump, which is fibrotic and fixed to underlying tissue or overlying skin as well as signs of nipple retraction. Fat necrosis is difficult to differentiate from breast cancer.
- ***Mastitis.*** Breast dimpling may signal bacterial mastitis, which usually results from duct obstruction and milk stasis during lactation. Heat, erythema, swelling, induration, pain, and tenderness usually accompany mastitis. Dimpling is more likely to occur with diffuse induration than with a single hard mass. The skin on the breast may feel fixed to underlying tissue. Other possible findings include nipple retraction, nipple cracks, a purulent discharge, and enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Flulike signs and symptoms (such as fever, malaise, fatigue, and aching) commonly occur.

**Special Considerations**

Remember that any breast problem can arouse fears of altered body image, mutilation, loss of sexuality, and death. Allow the patient to express her feelings.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain what to expect during diagnostic testing and the importance of clinical breast examination and mammography, following the American Cancer Society guidelines. Teach the patient how to perform breast self-examination and about the cause of breast dimpling. Also, teach her about the treatment plan after a diagnosis is established. If the patient breast-feeds and has mastitis, advise her to pump her breasts to prevent milk stasis, to discard the milk, and to substitute formula until the infection resolves.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Because breast cancer, the most likely cause of dimpling, is extremely rare in children, consider trauma as a likely cause. As in adults, breast dimpling may occur in adolescents from fatty tissue necrosis due to trauma.

**Breast Nodule**

**(See Also Breast Dimpling, Breast Pain, Breast Ulcer)**

**[Breast lump]**

A commonly reported gynecologic sign, a breast nodule has two chief causes: benign breast disease and cancer. Benign breast disease, the leading cause of nodules, can stem from cyst formation in obstructed and dilated lactiferous ducts, hypertrophy or tumor formation in the ductal system, inflammation, or infection.

Although fewer than 20% of breast nodules are malignant, the signs and symptoms of breast cancer aren’t easily distinguished from those of benign breast disease. Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women, but can occur occasionally in men, with signs and symptoms mimicking those found in women. Thus, breast nodules in both sexes should always be evaluated.

A woman who’s familiar with the feel of her breasts and performs monthly breast self-examination can detect a nodule 6.4 mm or less in size, considerably smaller than the 1-cm nodule that’s readily detectable by an experienced examiner. However, a woman may fail to report a nodule because of the fear of breast cancer.

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient reports a lump, ask her how and when she discovered it. Does the size and tenderness of the lump vary with her menstrual cycle? Has the lump changed since she first noticed it? Has she noticed other breast signs, such as a change in breast shape, size, or contour, a discharge, or nipple changes?

Is she breast-feeding? Does she have fever, chills, fatigue, or other flulike signs or symptoms? Ask her to describe any pain or tenderness associated with the lump. Is the pain in one breast only? Has she sustained recent trauma to the breast?

Explore the patient’s medical and family history for factors that increase her risk of breast cancer. These include a high-fat diet, having a mother or sister with breast cancer, or having a history of cancer, especially cancer in the other breast. Other risk factors include nulliparity and a first pregnancy after age 30.

![ref4] **CULTURAL CUE**

*In the United States, breast cancer incidence is higher among white women than any other racial or ethnic group. Yet, breast cancer mortality is highest among black women.*

Next, perform a thorough breast examination. Pay special attention to the upper outer quadrant of each breast, where one-half of the ductal tissue is located. This is the most common site of malignant breast tumors.

Carefully palpate a suspected breast nodule, noting its location, shape, size, consistency, mobility, and delineation. Does the nodule feel soft, rubbery, and elastic or hard? Is it mobile, slipping away from your fingers as you palpate it, or firmly fixed to adjacent tissue? Does the nodule seem to limit the mobility of the entire breast? Note the nodule’s delineation. Are the borders clearly defined or indefinite? Does the area feel more like a hardness or diffuse induration than a nodule with definite borders?

Do you feel one nodule or several small ones? Is the shape round, oval, lobular, or irregular? Inspect and palpate the skin over the nodule for warmth, redness, and edema. Palpate the lymph nodes of the breast and axilla for enlargement.

Observe the contour of the breasts, looking for asymmetry and irregularities. Be alert for signs of retraction, such as skin dimpling and nipple deviation, retraction, or flattening. (To exaggerate dimpling, have your patient raise her arms over her head or press her hands against her hips.) Gently pull the breast skin toward the clavicle. Is dimpling evident? Mold the breast skin and again observe the area for dimpling.

Be alert for a nipple discharge that’s spontaneous, unilateral, and nonmilky (serous, bloody, or purulent). Be careful not to confuse it with the grayish discharge that can be elicited from the nipples of a woman who has been pregnant. (See *Breast Nodule: Common Causes and Associated Findings*, page 122.)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Adenofibroma.*** The extremely mobile or “slippery” feel of this benign neoplasm helps distinguish it from other breast nodules. The nodule usually occurs singly and characteristically feels firm, elastic, and round or lobular, with well-defined margins. It doesn’t cause pain or tenderness, can vary from pinhead size to very large, commonly grows rapidly, and usually lies around the nipple or on the lateral side of the upper outer quadrant.
  - ***Areolar gland abscess.*** Areolar gland abscess is a tender, palpable mass on the periphery of the areola following an inflammation of the sebaceous glands of Montgomery. Fever may also be present.

**Breast Nodule: Common Causes and Associated Findings![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.120.png)**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.121.jpeg)

- ***Breast abscess.*** A localized, hot, tender, fluctuant mass with erythema and peau d’orange typifies an acute abscess. Associated signs and symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, and generalized discomfort. With a chronic abscess, the nodule is nontender, irregular, and firm and may feel like a thick wall of fibrous tissue. It’s commonly accompanied by skin dimpling, peau d’orange, nipple retraction and, sometimes, axillary lymphadenopathy.
  - ***Breast cancer.*** A hard, poorly delineated nodule that’s fixed to the skin or underlying tissue suggests breast cancer. Malignant nodules typically cause breast dimpling, nipple deviation or retraction, or flattening of the nipple or breast contour. Between 40% and 50% of malignant nodules occur in the upper outer quadrant.

    Nodules usually occur singly, although satellite nodules may surround the main one. They’re usually nontender. Nipple discharge may be serous or bloody. (A bloody nipple discharge in the presence of a nodule is a classic sign of breast cancer.) Additional findings include edema (peau d’orange) of the skin overlying the mass, erythema, tenderness, and axillary lymphadenopathy. A breast ulcer may occur as a late sign. Breast pain, an unreliable symptom, may be present.

- ***Fibrocystic breast disease.*** The most common cause of breast nodules, this fibrocystic condition produces smooth, round, slightly elastic nodules, which increase in size and tenderness just before menstruation. The nodules may occur in fine, granular clusters in both breasts or as widespread, well- defined lumps of varying sizes. A thickening of adjacent tissue may be palpable. Cystic nodules are mobile, which helps differentiate them from malignant ones. Because cystic nodules aren’t fixed to underlying breast tissue, they don’t produce retraction signs, such as nipple deviation or dimpling. Signs and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome — including headache, irritability, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping
  - may also be present.
  - ***Mammary duct ectasia.*** The rubbery breast nodule in mammary duct ectasia, a menopausal or postmenopausal disorder, usually lies under the areola. It’s commonly accompanied by transient pain, itching, tenderness, and erythema of the areola; thick, sticky, multicolored nipple discharge from multiple ducts; and nipple retraction. The skin overlying the mass may be bluish green or exhibit peau d’orange. Axillary lymphadenopathy is possible.
    - ***Mastitis.*** With mastitis, breast nodules feel firm and indurated or tender, flocculent, and discrete. Gentle palpation defines the area of maximum purulent accumulation. Skin dimpling and nipple deviation, retraction, or flattening may be present, and the nipple may show a crack or abrasion. Accompanying signs and symptoms include breast warmth, erythema, tenderness, and peau d’orange, as well as a high fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue.
- ***Paget’s disease.*** Paget’s disease is a slow-growing intraductal carcinoma that begins as a scaling, eczematoid unilateral nipple lesion. The nipple later becomes reddened and excoriated and may eventually be completely destroyed. The process extends along the skin as well as in the ducts, usually progressing to a deep-seated mass.

**Special Considerations**

Although many women regard a breast lump as a sign of breast cancer, most nodules are benign. As a result, try to avoid alarming the patient further. Provide a simple explanation of your examination, and encourage her to express her feelings.

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, which may include transillumination, mammography, thermography, needle aspiration or open biopsy of the nodule for tissue examination, and cytologic examination of nipple discharge.

Postpone teaching the patient how to perform breast self-examination until she overcomes her initial anxiety at discovering a nodule. Regular breast self- examination is especially important for women who have had a previous cancer, have a family history of breast cancer, are nulliparous, or had their first child after age 30.

Although most nodules occurring in the breast-feeding patient result from mastitis, the possibility of cancer demands careful evaluation. Advise the patient with mastitis to pump her breasts to prevent further milk stasis, to discard the milk, and to substitute formula until the infection responds to antibiotics.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient the techniques of breast self-examination. Explain how to treat mastitis.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Most nodules in children and adolescents reflect the normal response of breast tissue to hormonal fluctuations. For instance, the breasts of young teenage girls may normally contain cordlike nodules that become tender just before menstruation.

A transient breast nodule in young boys (as well as in women between ages 20 and 30) may result from juvenile mastitis, which usually affects one breast. Signs of inflammation are present in a firm mass beneath the nipple.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In women age 70 and older, three-quarters of all breast lumps are malignant.

**Breast Pain**

**(See Also Breast Dimpling, Breast Nodule, Breast Ulcer) [Mastalgia]**

An unreliable indicator of cancer, breast pain commonly results from benign breast disease. It may occur during rest or movement and may be aggravated by manipulation or palpation. (Breast *tenderness* refers to pain elicited by physical contact.) Breast pain may be unilateral or bilateral; cyclic, intermittent, or constant; and dull or sharp. It may result from surface cuts, furuncles, contusions, or similar lesions (superficial pain); nipple fissures or inflammation in the papillary ducts or areolae (severe localized pain); stromal distention in the breast parenchyma; a tumor that affects nerve endings (severe, constant pain); or inflammatory lesions that distend the stroma and irritate sensory nerve endings (severe, constant pain). Breast pain may radiate to the back, the arms, and, sometimes, the neck.

Breast tenderness in women may occur before menstruation and during pregnancy. Before menstruation, breast pain or tenderness stems from increased mammary blood flow due to hormonal changes. During pregnancy, breast tenderness and throbbing, tingling, or pricking sensations may occur, also from hormonal changes. In men, breast pain may stem from gynecomastia (especially during puberty and senescence), reproductive tract anomalies, or organic disease of the liver or pituitary, adrenal cortex, or thyroid glands.

**History and Physical Examination**

Begin by asking the patient if breast pain is constant or intermittent. For either type, ask about onset and character. If it’s intermittent, determine the relationship of pain to the phase of the menstrual cycle. Is the patient a nursing mother? If not, ask about any nipple discharge and have her describe it. Is she pregnant? Has she reached menopause? Has she recently experienced flulike symptoms or sustained injury to the breast? Has she noticed a change in breast shape or contour?

Ask the patient to describe the pain. She may describe it as sticking, stinging, shooting, stabbing, throbbing, or burning. Determine if the pain affects one

breast or both, and ask the patient to point to the painful area.

Instruct the patient to place her arms at her sides, and inspect the breasts. Note their size, symmetry, and contour and the appearance of the skin. Remember that breast shape and size vary and that breasts normally change during menses, pregnancy, and lactation and with aging. Are the breasts red or edematous? Are the veins prominent?

Note the size, shape, and symmetry of the nipples and areolae. Do you detect ecchymosis, a rash, ulceration, or a discharge? Do the nipples point in the same direction? Do you see signs of retraction, such as skin dimpling or nipple inversion or flattening? Repeat your inspection, first with the patient’s arms raised above her head and then with her hands pressed against her hips.

Palpate the breasts, first with the patient seated and then with her lying down and a pillow placed under her shoulder on the side being examined. Use the pads of your fingers to compress breast tissue against the chest wall. Proceed systematically from the sternum to the midline and from the axilla to the midline, noting any warmth, tenderness, nodules, masses, or irregularities. Palpate the nipple, noting tenderness and nodules, and check for discharge. Palpate axillary lymph nodes, noting any enlargement. (See *Breast Pain: Common Causes and Associated Findings*.)

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.123.png)

**Medical Causes**

- ***Areolar gland abscess.*** Areolar gland abscess is a tender, palpable mass on the periphery of the areola following an inflammation of the sebaceous glands of Montgomery. Fever may also occur.
  - ***Breast abscess (acute).*** In the affected breast, local pain, tenderness, erythema, peau d’orange, and warmth are associated with a nodule. Malaise, fever, and chills may also occur.
    - ***Breast cyst.*** A breast cyst that enlarges rapidly may cause acute, localized, and usually unilateral pain. A palpable breast nodule may be present.
      - ***Fat necrosis.*** Local pain and tenderness may develop in fat necrosis, a benign disorder. A history of trauma usually is present. Associated findings include ecchymosis; erythema of the overriding skin; a firm, irregular, fixed mass; and skin retraction signs, such as skin dimpling and nipple retraction.

        Fat necrosis may be hard to differentiate from cancer.

- ***Fibrocystic breast disease.*** Fibrocystic breast disease is a common cause of breast pain that’s associated with the development of cysts that may cause pain before menstruation and are asymptomatic afterward. Later in the course of the disorder, pain and tenderness may persist throughout the cycle. The cysts feel firm, mobile, and well defined. Many are bilateral and found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, but others are unilateral and generalized. Signs and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome — including headache, irritability, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping
  - may also be present.
  - ***Mammary duct ectasia.*** Burning pain and itching around the areola may occur, although ectasia is commonly asymptomatic at first. The history may include one or more episodes of inflammation with pain, tenderness, erythema, and acute fever, or with pain and tenderness alone, which develop and then subside spontaneously within 7 to 10 days. Other findings include a rubbery, subareolar breast nodule; swelling and erythema around the nipple; nipple retraction; a bluish green discoloration or peau d’orange of the skin overlying the nodule; a thick, sticky, multicolored nipple discharge from multiple ducts; and axillary lymphadenopathy. A breast ulcer may occur in late stages.
    - ***Mastitis.*** Unilateral pain may be severe, particularly when the inflammation occurs near the skin surface. Breast skin is typically red and warm at the inflammation site; peau d’orange may be present. Palpation reveals a firm area of induration. Skin retraction signs — such as breast dimpling and nipple deviation, inversion, or flattening — may be present. Systemic signs and symptoms — such as high fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue — may also occur.
      - ***Sebaceous cyst (infected).*** Breast pain may be reported with sebaceous cyst, a cutaneous cyst. Associated symptoms include a small, well- delineated nodule, localized erythema, and induration.

**Special Considerations**

Provide emotional support for the patient, and emphasize the importance of monthly breast self-examination.

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as mammography, ultrasonography, thermography, cytology of nipple discharge, biopsy, or culture of any aspirate.

**Patient Counseling**

Instruct the patient on the correct type of brassiere, teach the techniques of breast self-examination, and stress the importance of monthly self-examination. Explain the use of warm or cold compresses.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Transient gynecomastia can cause breast pain in males during puberty.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Breast pain secondary to benign breast disease is rare in postmenopausal women. Breast pain can also be due to trauma from falls or physical abuse. Because of decreased pain perception and decreased cognitive function, elderly patients may not report breast pain.

**Breast Ulcer**

**(See Also Breast Dimpling, Breast Nodule, Breast Pain)**

Appearing on the nipple, areola, or the breast itself, an ulcer indicates destruction of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. A breast ulcer is usually a late sign of cancer, appearing well after the confirming diagnosis. Breast ulcers can also result from trauma, infection, or radiation.

**History and Physical Examination**

Begin the history by asking when the patient first noticed the ulcer and if it was preceded by other breast changes, such as nodules, edema, or nipple discharge, deviation, or retraction. Does the ulcer seem to be getting better or worse? Does it cause pain or produce drainage? Has she noticed any change in breast shape?

Has she had a skin rash? If she has been treating the ulcer at home, find out how.

Review the patient’s personal and family history for factors that increase the risk of breast cancer. Ask, for example, about previous cancer, especially of the breast, and mastectomy. Determine whether the patient’s mother or sister has had breast cancer. Ask the patient’s age at menarche and menopause because more than 30 years of menstrual activity increases the risk of breast cancer. Also, ask about pregnancy because nulliparity or birth of a first child after age 30 also increases the risk of breast cancer.

If the patient recently gave birth, ask if she breast-feeds her infant or has recently weaned him. Ask if she’s currently taking an oral antibiotic and if she’s diabetic. All these factors predispose the patient to *Candida* infections.

Inspect the patient’s breast, noting any asymmetry or flattening. Look for a rash, scaling, cracking, or red excoriation on the nipples, areola, and inframammary fold. Check especially for skin changes, such as warmth, erythema, or peau d’orange. Palpate the breast for masses, noting any induration beneath the ulcer. Then, carefully palpate for tenderness or nodules around the areola and the axillary lymph nodes.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Breast cancer.*** A breast ulcer that doesn’t heal within a month usually indicates cancer. Ulceration along a mastectomy scar may indicate metastatic cancer; a nodule beneath the ulcer may be a late sign of a fulminating tumor. Other signs include a palpable breast nodule, skin dimpling, nipple retraction, bloody or serous nipple discharge, erythema, peau d’orange, and enlarged axillary lymph nodes.

![ref3] **GENDER CUE**

*A breast ulcer may be the presenting sign of breast cancer in men, who are more apt to miss or dismiss earlier breast changes.*

- ***Breast trauma.*** Tissue destruction with inadequate healing may produce breast ulcers. Associated signs depend on the type of trauma but may include ecchymosis, lacerations, abrasions, swelling, and hematoma.
  - **Candida albicans *infection.*** Severe *Candida* infection can cause maceration of breast tissue followed by ulceration. Well-defined, bright-red papular patches — usually with scaly borders — characterize the infection, which can develop in the breast folds. In breast-feeding women, cracked nipples predispose them to infection. Women describe the pain, felt when the infant sucks, as a burning pain that penetrates into the chest wall.
- ***Paget’s disease.*** Bright-red nipple excoriation can extend to the areola and ulcerate. Serous or bloody nipple discharge and extreme nipple itching may accompany ulceration. Symptoms are usually unilateral.

**Other Causes**

- ***Radiation therapy***. After treatment, the breasts appear “sunburned.” Subsequently, the skin ulcerates and the surrounding area becomes red and tender.

**Special Considerations**

If breast cancer is suspected, provide emotional support and encourage the patient to express her feelings. Prepare her for diagnostic tests, such as ultrasonography, thermography, mammography, nipple discharge cytology, and breast biopsy. If a *Candida* infection is suspected, prepare her for skin or blood cultures.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient how to apply a topical antifungal or antibacterial ointment or cream. Instruct her to keep the ulcer dry to reduce chafing and to wear loose- fitting undergarments. Explain the importance of clinical breast examination and mammography following the American Cancer Society guidelines. Teach the patient about the cause of the breast ulcer and about the treatment plan after the diagnosis is established.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Because of the increased breast cancer risk in this population, breast ulcers should be considered cancerous until proven otherwise. However, ulcers can also result from normal skin changes in the elderly, such as thinning, decreased vascularity, and loss of elasticity, as well as from poor skin hygiene. Pressure ulcers may result from restraints and tight brassieres; traumatic ulcers may result from falls or abuse.

**Breath with Ammonia Odor [Uremic fetor]**

The odor of ammonia on the breath — described as urinous or “fishy” breath — typically occurs in end-stage chronic renal failure. This sign improves slightly after hemodialysis and persists throughout the course of the disorder, but isn’t of great concern.

Ammonia breath odor reflects the long-term metabolic disturbances and biochemical abnormalities associated with uremia and end-stage chronic renal failure. It’s produced by metabolic end products blown off by the lungs and the breakdown of urea (to ammonia) in the saliva. However, a specific uremic toxin hasn’t been identified. In animals, breath odor analysis has revealed toxic metabolites, such as dimethylamine and trimethylamine, which contribute to the “fishy” odor. The source of these amines, although still unclear, may be intestinal bacteria acting on dietary chlorine.

**History and Physical Examination**

When you detect ammonia breath odor, the diagnosis of chronic renal failure will probably be well established. Look for associated GI symptoms so that palliative care and support can be individualized.

Inspect the patient’s oral cavity for bleeding, swollen gums or tongue, and ulceration with drainage. Ask the patient if he has experienced a metallic taste, loss of smell, increased thirst, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite at the sight of food, or early morning vomiting. Because GI bleeding is common in patients with chronic renal failure, ask about bowel habits, noting especially melanous stools or constipation.

Take the patient’s vital signs. Watch for indications of hypertension (the patient with end-stage chronic renal failure is usually somewhat hypertensive) or hypotension. Be alert for other signs of shock (such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and cool, clammy skin) and altered mental status. Significant changes can indicate complications, such as massive GI bleeding or pericarditis with tamponade.

**Medical Causes**

- ***End-stage chronic renal failure.*** Ammonia breath odor is a late finding. Accompanying signs and symptoms include anuria, skin pigmentation changes and excoriation, brown arcs under the nail margins, tissue wasting, Kussmaul’s respirations, neuropathy, lethargy, somnolence, confusion, disorientation, behavior changes with irritability, and mood lability. Later neurologic signs that signal impending uremic coma include muscle twitching and fasciculation, asterixis, paresthesia, and footdrop. Cardiovascular findings include hypertension, myocardial infarction, signs of heart failure, pericarditis, and even sudden death and stroke. GI findings include anorexia, nausea, heartburn, vomiting, constipation, hiccups, and a metallic taste, with oral signs and symptoms, such as stomatitis, gum ulceration and bleeding, and a coated tongue. The patient has an increased risk of peptic ulceration and acute pancreatitis. Weight loss is common; uremic frost, pruritus, and signs of hormonal changes, such as impotence or amenorrhea, also appear.

**Special Considerations**

Ammonia breath odor is offensive to others, but the patient may become accustomed to it. As a result, remind him to perform frequent mouth care. If he’s unable to perform mouth care, do it for him and teach his family members how to assist him.

Maximize dietary intake by offering the patient frequent small meals of his favorite foods, within dietary limitations.

**Patient Counseling**

Instruct the patient to perform regular mouth care, particularly before meals, because reducing foul mouth taste and odor may stimulate his appetite. Tell him to use a half-strength hydrogen peroxide mixture of lemon juice gargle to help neutralize the ammonia. Recommend the use of commercial lozenges or breath sprays or to suck on hard candy to freshen his breath. Advise him to use a soft toothbrush or sponge to prevent trauma. Teach the patient about the cause of the ammonia breath odor after a diagnosis is established.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Ammonia breath odor also occurs in children with end-stage chronic renal

failure. Provide hard candies to relieve bad mouth taste and odor. If the child is able to gargle, try mixing hydrogen peroxide with flavored mouthwashes.

**Breath with Fecal Odor**

Fecal breath odor typically accompanies fecal vomiting associated with a long- standing intestinal obstruction or gastrojejunocolic fistula. It represents an important late diagnostic clue to a potentially life-threatening GI disorder because complete obstruction of any part of the bowel, if untreated, can cause death within hours from vascular collapse and shock.

When the obstructed or adynamic intestine attempts self-decompression by regurgitating its contents, vigorous peristaltic waves propel bowel contents backward into the stomach. When the stomach fills with intestinal fluid, further reverse peristalsis results in vomiting. The odor of feculent vomitus lingers in the mouth.

Fecal breath odor may also occur in patients with a nasogastric (NG) or intestinal tube. The odor is detected only while the underlying disorder persists and abates soon after its resolution.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*Because fecal breath odor signals a potentially life-threatening intestinal obstruction, you’ll need to quickly evaluate the patient’s condition. Monitor his vital signs, and be alert for signs of shock, such as hypotension, tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, and cool, clammy skin. Ask the patient if he’s experiencing nausea or has vomited. Find out the frequency of vomiting as well as the color, odor, amount, and consistency of the vomitus. Have an emesis basin nearby to collect and accurately measure the vomitus.*

*Anticipate possible surgery to relieve an obstruction or repair a fistula,*

*and withhold all food and fluids. Be prepared to insert an NG or intestinal tube for GI tract decompression. Insert a peripheral I.V. line for vascular access, or assist with central line insertion for large-bore access and central venous pressure monitoring. Obtain a blood sample and send it to the laboratory for complete blood count and electrolyte analysis because large fluid losses and shifts can produce electrolyte imbalances. Maintain adequate hydration, and support circulatory status with additional fluids. Give a physiologic solution — such as lactated Ringer’s solution or normal saline or Plasmanate — to prevent metabolic acidosis from gastric losses and metabolic alkalosis from intestinal fluid losses.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient’s condition permits, ask about previous abdominal surgery because adhesions can cause an obstruction. Also, ask about loss of appetite. Is the patient experiencing abdominal pain? If so, have him describe its onset, duration, and location. Ask if the pain is intense, persistent, or spasmodic. Have the patient describe his normal bowel habits, especially noting constipation, diarrhea, or leakage of stool. Ask when the patient’s last bowel movement occurred, and have him describe the stool’s color and consistency.

Auscultate for bowel sounds — hyperactive, high-pitched sounds may indicate *impending* bowel obstruction, whereas hypoactive or absent sounds occur *late* in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Inspect the abdomen, noting its contour and any surgical scars. Measure abdominal girth to provide baseline data for subsequent assessment of distention. Palpate for tenderness, distention, and rigidity. Percuss for tympany, indicating a gas-filled bowel, and dullness, indicating fluid.

Rectal and pelvic examinations should be performed. All patients with a suspected bowel obstruction should have a flat and upright abdominal X-ray; some will also need a chest X-ray, sigmoidoscopy, and barium enema.

**Medical Causes**

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.124.png) ***Distal small-bowel obstruction.*** With late obstruction, nausea is present although vomiting may be delayed. Vomitus initially consists of gastric contents, then changes to bilious contents, followed by fecal contents with resultant fecal breath odor. Accompanying symptoms include achiness, malaise, drowsiness, and polydipsia. Bowel changes (ranging from diarrhea to constipation) are accompanied by abdominal distention, persistent

epigastric or periumbilical colicky pain, and hyperactive bowel sounds and borborygmi. As the obstruction becomes complete, bowel sounds become hypoactive or absent. Fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and rebound tenderness may indicate strangulation or perforation.

- ***Gastrojejunocolic fistula.*** With gastrojejunocolic fistula, symptoms may be variable and intermittent because of temporary plugging of the fistula. Fecal vomiting with resulting fecal breath odor may occur, but the most common chief complaint is diarrhea, accompanied by abdominal pain. Related GI findings include anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distention, and, possibly, marked malabsorption.
  - ***Large-bowel obstruction***. Vomiting is usually absent initially, but fecal vomiting with resultant fecal breath odor occurs as a late sign. Typically, symptoms develop more slowly than in small-bowel obstruction. Colicky abdominal pain appears suddenly, followed by continuous hypogastric pain. Marked abdominal distention and tenderness occur, and loops of large bowel may be visible through the abdominal wall. Although constipation develops, defecation may continue for up to 3 days after complete obstruction because of stool remaining in the bowel below the obstruction. Leakage of stool is common with partial obstruction.

**Special Considerations**

After an NG or intestinal tube has been inserted, keep the head of the bed elevated at least 30 degrees and turn the patient to facilitate passage of the intestinal tube through the GI tract. Don’t tape the intestinal tube to the patient’s face. Ensure tube patency by monitoring drainage and watching that suction devices function properly. Irrigate as required. Monitor GI drainage, and send serum specimens to the laboratory for electrolyte analysis at least once per day. Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as abdominal X-rays, barium enema, and proctoscopy.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain to the patient the procedures and treatments he needs. Teach the patient the techniques of good oral hygiene, and explain food and fluid restrictions that are needed.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Carefully monitor the child’s fluid and electrolyte status because dehydration can

occur rapidly from persistent vomiting. The absence of tears and dry or parched mucous membranes are important clinical signs of dehydration.

**Geriatric Pointers**

In older patients, early surgical intervention may be necessary for a bowel obstruction that doesn’t respond to decompression because of the high risk of bowel infarct.

**Breath with Fruity Odor**

Fruity breath odor results from respiratory elimination of excess acetone. This sign characteristically occurs with ketoacidosis — a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent severe dehydration, irreversible coma, and death.

Ketoacidosis results from the excessive catabolism of fats for cellular energy in the absence of usable carbohydrates. This process begins when insulin levels are insufficient to transport glucose into the cells, as in diabetes mellitus, or when glucose is unavailable and hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, as in low- carbohydrate diets and malnutrition. Lacking glucose, the cells burn fat faster than enzymes can handle the ketones, the acidic end products. As a result, the ketones (acetone, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetoacetic acid) accumulate in the blood and urine. To compensate for increased acidity, Kussmaul’s respirations expel carbon dioxide with enough acetone to flavor the breath. Eventually, this compensatory mechanism fails, producing ketoacidosis.

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*When you detect fruity breath odor, check for Kussmaul’s respirations and examine the patient’s level of consciousness (LOC). Take his vital signs, and check skin turgor. Be alert for fruity breath odor that accompanies rapid, deep respirations, stupor, and poor skin turgor. Try to obtain a brief history,* *noting especially diabetes mellitus, nutritional problems such as anorexia nervosa, and fad diets with little or no carbohydrates. Obtain venous and arterial blood samples for glucose, complete blood count, and electrolyte, acetone, and arterial blood gas (ABG) levels. Also, obtain a urine specimen to test for glucose and acetone. Administer I.V. fluids and electrolytes to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance and, in the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis, give regular insulin to reduce blood glucose levels.*

*If the patient is obtunded, you’ll need to insert endotracheal and nasogastric (NG) tubes. Suction as needed. Insert an indwelling urinary catheter, and monitor intake and output. Insert central venous pressure and arterial lines to monitor the patient’s fluid status and blood pressure. Place the patient on a cardiac monitor, monitor his vital signs and neurologic status, and draw blood hourly to check glucose, electrolyte, acetone, and ABG levels.*

**History and Physical Examination**

If the patient isn’t in severe distress, obtain a thorough history. Ask about the onset and duration of fruity breath odor. Find out about changes in breathing pattern. Ask about increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Ask the female patient if she has had candidal vaginitis or vaginal secretions with itching. If the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, ask about stress, infections, and noncompliance with therapy — the most common causes of ketoacidosis in known diabetics. If the patient is suspected of having anorexia nervosa, obtain a dietary and weight history.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Anorexia nervosa.*** Severe weight loss associated with anorexia nervosa may produce fruity breath, usually with nausea, constipation, and cold intolerance, as well as dental enamel erosion and scars or calluses in the dorsum of the hand, both related to induced vomiting.
  - ***Ketoacidosis.*** Fruity breath odor accompanies alcoholic ketoacidosis, which is usually seen in poorly nourished alcoholics with vomiting, abdominal pain, and only minimal food intake over several days. Kussmaul’s respirations begin abruptly and accompany dehydration, abdominal pain and distention, and absent bowel sounds. Blood glucose levels are normal or slightly decreased.

    With diabetic ketoacidosis, fruity breath odor commonly occurs as

ketoacidosis develops over 1 to 2 days. Other findings include polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, a weak and rapid pulse, hunger, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Eventually, Kussmaul’s respirations, orthostatic hypotension, dehydration, tachycardia, confusion, and stupor occur. Signs and symptoms may lead to coma.

Starvation ketoacidosis is a potentially life-threatening disorder that has a gradual onset. Besides fruity breath odor, typical findings include signs of cachexia and dehydration, a decreased LOC, bradycardia, and a history of severely limited food intake (anorexia nervosa).

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Any drug known to cause metabolic acidosis, such as nitroprusside and salicylates, can result in fruity breath odor.
  - ***Low-carbohydrate diets.*** These diets, which encourage little or no carbohydrate intake, may cause ketoacidosis and the resulting fruity breath odor.

**Special Considerations**

Provide emotional support for the patient and his family. Explain tests and treatments clearly. When the patient is more alert and his condition stabilizes, remove the NG tube and start him on an appropriate diet. Switch his insulin from the I.V. to the subcutaneous route.

**Patient Counseling**

Explain the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia. Emphasize the importance of wearing medical identification. Refer the patient to a psychological or support group, as needed.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Fruity breath odor in an infant or child usually stems from uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Ketoacidosis develops rapidly in this age group because of low glycogen reserves. As a result, prompt administration of insulin and correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance are necessary to prevent shock and death.

**Geriatric Pointers**

The elderly patient may have poor oral hygiene, increased dental caries,

decreased salivary function with dryness, and poor dietary intake. In addition, he may take multiple drugs. Consider all of these factors when evaluating an elderly patient with mouth odor.

**Brudzinski’s Sign**

A positive Brudzinski’s sign (flexion of the hips and knees in response to passive flexion of the neck) signals meningeal irritation. Passive flexion of the neck stretches the nerve roots, causing pain and involuntary flexion of the knees and hips.

Brudzinski’s sign is a common and important early indicator of life- threatening meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. It can be elicited in children as well as adults, although more reliable indicators of meningeal irritation exist for infants.

Testing for Brudzinski’s sign isn’t part of the routine examination, unless meningeal irritation is suspected. (See *Testing for Brudzinski’s Sign*.)

![ref1] **EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS**

*If the patient is alert, ask him about headache, neck pain, nausea, and vision disturbances (blurred or double vision and photophobia) — all indications of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Next, observe the patient for signs and symptoms of increased ICP, such as an altered level of consciousness (LOC) (restlessness, irritability, confusion, lethargy, personality changes, and coma), pupillary changes, bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, irregular respiratory patterns (Cheyne-Stokes or Kussmaul’s respirations), vomiting, and moderate fever.*

*Keep artificial airways, intubation equipment, a handheld resuscitation bag, and suction equipment on hand because the patient’s condition may suddenly deteriorate. Elevate the head of his bed 30 to 60 degrees to promote venous drainage. Administer an osmotic diuretic, such as mannitol, to reduce cerebral edema.*

*Monitor ICP and be alert for ICP that continues to rise. You may have to provide mechanical ventilation and administer a barbiturate and additional doses of a diuretic. Also, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have to be drained.*

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Testing for Brudzinski’s![ref5]**

**Sign**

Here’s how to test for Brudzinski’s sign when you suspect meningeal irritation:

With the patient in a supine position, place your hands behind her neck and lift her head toward her chest.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.126.png)

If your patient has meningeal irritation, she’ll flex her hips and knees in response to the passive neck flexion.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.127.png)

**History and Physical Examination**

Continue your neurologic examination by evaluating the patient’s cranial nerve function, noting motor or sensory deficits. Be sure to look for Kernig’s sign (resistance to knee extension after flexion of the hip), which is a further indication of meningeal irritation. Also, look for signs of central nervous system infection, such as fever and nuchal rigidity.

Ask the patient or his family, if necessary, about a history of hypertension, spinal arthritis, or recent head trauma. Also, ask about dental work and abscessed teeth (a possible cause of meningitis), open head injury, endocarditis, and I.V. drug abuse. Ask about sudden onset of headaches, which may be associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Arthritis.*** With severe spinal arthritis, a positive Brudzinski’s sign can occasionally be elicited. The patient may also report back pain (especially after weight bearing) and limited mobility.
  - ***Meningitis.*** A positive Brudzinski’s sign can usually be elicited 24 hours after the onset of meningitis, a life-threatening disorder. Accompanying findings may include headache, a positive Kernig’s sign, nuchal rigidity, irritability or restlessness, deep stupor or coma, vertigo, fever (high or low, depending on the severity of the infection), chills, malaise, hyperalgesia, muscular hypotonia, opisthotonos, symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, papilledema, ocular and facial palsies, nausea and vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, and unequal sluggish pupils. As ICP rises, arterial hypertension, bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, Cheyne-Stokes or Kussmaul’s respirations, and coma may develop.
- ***Subarachnoid hemorrhage.*** Brudzinski’s sign may be elicited within minutes after initial bleeding in subarachnoid hemorrhage, a life- threatening disorder. Accompanying signs and symptoms include the sudden onset of severe headache, nuchal rigidity, altered LOC, dizziness, photophobia, cranial nerve palsies (as evidenced by ptosis, pupil dilation, and limited extraocular muscle movement), nausea and vomiting, fever, and a positive Kernig’s sign. Focal signs — such as hemiparesis, vision disturbances, or aphasia — may also occur. As ICP rises, arterial hypertension, bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, Cheyne-Stokes or Kussmaul’s respirations, and coma may develop.

**Special Considerations**

Many patients with a positive Brudzinski’s sign are critically ill. They need constant ICP monitoring and frequent neurologic checks in addition to intensive assessment and monitoring of vital signs, intake and output, and cardiorespiratory status. To promote patient comfort, maintain low lights and minimal noise and elevate the head of the bed. The patient usually won’t receive an opioid analgesic because it may mask signs of increased ICP.

Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests. These may include blood, urine, and sputum cultures to identify bacteria, lumbar puncture to assess CSF and relieve pressure, and computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral angiography, and spinal X-rays to locate a hemorrhage.

**Patient Counseling**

Discuss the signs and symptoms of meningitis and subdural hematoma. Tell the patient when to seek immediate medical attention.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Brudzinski’s sign may not be useful as an indicator of meningeal irritation in infants because more reliable signs (such as bulging fontanels, a weak cry, fretfulness, vomiting, and poor feeding) appear early.

**Bruits**

Commonly an indicator of life-or limb-threatening vascular disease, bruits are swishing sounds caused by turbulent blood flow. They’re characterized by location, duration, intensity, pitch, and the time of onset in the cardiac cycle. Loud bruits produce intense vibration and a palpable thrill. A thrill, however, doesn’t provide a further clue to the causative disorder or to its severity.

Bruits are most significant when heard over the abdominal aorta; the renal, carotid, femoral, popliteal, or subclavian artery; or the thyroid gland. (See *Preventing False Bruits*, page 138.) They’re also significant when heard consistently despite changes in patient position and when heard during diastole.

**History and Physical Examination**

If you detect bruits over the abdominal aorta, check for a pulsating mass or a bluish discoloration around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign). Either of these signs

- or severe, tearing pain in the abdomen, flank, or lower back — may signal life-threatening dissection of an aortic aneurysm. Also, check peripheral pulses, comparing intensity in the upper versus lower extremities.

  If you suspect dissection, monitor the patient’s vital signs constantly, and withhold food and fluids until a definitive diagnosis is made. Watch for signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock, such as thirst; hypotension; tachycardia; a weak, thready pulse; tachypnea; an altered level of consciousness (LOC); mottled knees and elbows; and cool, clammy skin.

If you detect bruits over the thyroid gland, ask the patient if he has a history of hyperthyroidism or signs and symptoms of it, such as nervousness, tremors, weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, and (in females) amenorrhea. Watch for signs and symptoms of life-threatening thyroid storm, such as tremor, restlessness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly.

If you detect carotid artery bruits, be alert for signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), including dizziness, diplopia, slurred speech, flashing lights, and syncope. These findings may indicate an impending stroke. Be sure to evaluate the patient frequently for changes in LOC and muscle function.

If you detect bruits over the femoral, popliteal, or subclavian artery, watch for signs and symptoms of decreased or absent peripheral circulation — edema, weakness, and paresthesia. Ask the patient if he has a history of intermittent claudication. Frequently check distal pulses, skin color, and temperature. Also, watch for the sudden absence of pulse, pallor, or coolness, which may indicate a threat to the affected limb.

![ref2] **EXAMINATION TIP Preventing False Bruits![ref5]**

Auscultating bruits accurately requires practice and skill. These sounds typically stem from arterial luminal narrowing or arterial dilation, but they can also result from excessive pressure applied to the stethoscope’s bell during auscultation. This pressure compresses the artery, creating turbulent blood flow and a false bruit.

To prevent false bruits, place the bell lightly on the patient’s skin. Also, if you’re auscultating for a popliteal bruit, help the patient to a supine position, place your hand behind his ankle, and lift his leg slightly before placing the bell behind the knee.

![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.131.png)

If you detect a bruit, make sure to check for further vascular damage and perform a thorough cardiac assessment.

**Medical Causes**

- ***Abdominal aortic aneurysm.*** A pulsating periumbilical mass accompanied by a systolic bruit over the aorta characterizes abdominal aortic aneurysm. Associated signs and symptoms include a rigid, tender abdomen, mottled skin, diminished peripheral pulses, and claudication. Sharp, tearing pain in the abdomen, flank, or lower back signals imminent dissection.
  - ***Abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.*** Loud systolic bruits in the epigastric and

    midabdominal areas are common. They may be accompanied by leg weakness, numbness, paresthesia, or paralysis; leg pain; or decreased or absent femoral, popliteal, or pedal pulses. Abdominal pain is rarely present.

- ***Anemia.*** Increased cardiac output causes increased blood flow. In patients with severe anemia, short systolic bruits may be heard over both carotid arteries and may be accompanied by headache, fatigue, dizziness, pallor, jaundice, palpitations, mild tachycardia, dyspnea, nausea, anorexia, and glossitis.
  - ***Carotid artery stenosis.*** Systolic bruits can be heard over one or both carotid arteries. Other signs and symptoms may be absent. However, dizziness, vertigo, headache, syncope, aphasia, dysarthria, sudden vision loss, hemiparesis, or hemiparalysis signals a TIA and may herald a stroke.
    - ***Carotid cavernous fistula.*** Continuous bruits heard over the eyeballs and temples are characteristic, as are vision disturbances and protruding, pulsating eyeballs.
      - ***Peripheral arteriovenous fistula.*** A rough, continuous bruit with systolic accentuation may be heard over the fistula; a palpable thrill is also common.
        - ***Peripheral vascular disease.*** Peripheral vascular disease characteristically produces bruits over the femoral artery and other arteries in the legs. It can also cause diminished or absent femoral, popliteal, or pedal pulses; intermittent claudication; numbness, weakness, pain, and cramping in the legs, feet, and hips; and cool, shiny skin and hair loss on the affected extremity. It also predisposes the patient to lower-extremity ulcers that heal with difficulty.
          - ***Renal artery stenosis.*** Systolic bruits are commonly heard over the abdominal midline and flank on the affected side. Hypertension commonly accompanies stenosis. Headache, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dizziness, retinopathy, hematuria, and mental sluggishness may also appear.
            - ***Subclavian steal syndrome.*** With subclavian steal syndrome, systolic bruits may be heard over one or both subclavian arteries as a result of arterial lumen narrowing. They may be accompanied by decreased blood pressure and claudication in the affected arm, hemiparesis, vision disturbances, vertigo, and dysarthria.
              - ***Thyrotoxicosis.*** A systolic bruit is commonly heard over the thyroid gland. Accompanying signs and symptoms appear in all body systems, but the most characteristic ones include thyroid enlargement, fatigue, nervousness, tachycardia, heat intolerance, sweating, tremor, diarrhea, and weight loss despite increased appetite. Exophthalmos may also be present.

**Special Considerations**

Because bruits can signal a life-threatening vascular disorder, frequently check the patient’s vital signs, auscultate over the affected arteries, and monitor peripheral pulses. Be especially alert for bruits that become louder or develop a diastolic component.

As needed, administer prescribed drugs, such as a vasodilator, an anticoagulant, an antiplatelet drug, or an antihypertensive. Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests, such as blood studies, radiographs, an electrocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, and ultrasonography.

**Patient Counseling**

Teach the patient the symptoms of stroke, and tell him to report them immediately. Discuss lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Bruits are common in young children but are usually of little significance — for example, cranial bruits are normal until age 4. However, certain bruits may be significant. Because birthmarks commonly accompany congenital arteriovenous fistulas, carefully auscultate for bruits in children with port-wine spots or cavernous or diffuse hemangiomas.

**Geriatric Pointers**

Elderly people with atherosclerosis may experience bruits over several arteries. Those related to carotid artery stenosis are particularly important because of the high incidence of associated stroke. Close follow-up is mandatory as well as prompt surgical referral when indicated.

**Butterfly Rash**

The presence of a butterfly rash is typically a sign of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but it can also signal dermatologic disorders. Typically, butterfly rash appears in a malar distribution across the nose and cheeks. (See *Recognizing Butterfly Rash*.) Similar rashes may appear on the neck, scalp, and other areas. Butterfly rash is sometimes mistaken for sunburn because it can be provoked or aggravated by ultraviolet rays, but it has more substance, is more sharply demarcated, and has a thicker feel in relation to surrounding skin.

**History and Physical Examination**

Ask the patient when he first noticed the butterfly rash and if he has recently been exposed to the sun. Has he noticed a rash elsewhere on his body? Also, ask about recent weight or hair loss. Does he have a family history of lupus? Is he taking hydralazine or procainamide (common causes of drug-induced lupus erythematosus [LE])?

Inspect the rash, noting any macules, papules, pustules, or scaling. Is the rash edematous? Are areas of hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation present? Look for blisters or ulcers in the mouth, and note any inflamed lesions. Check for rashes elsewhere on the body.

- ***Discoid lupus erythematosus.*** With discoid lupus erythematosus, a localized form of LE, the patient may come into your facility with a unilateral or butterfly rash that consists of erythematous, raised, sharply demarcated plaques with follicular plugging and central atrophy. The rash may also involve the scalp, ears, chest, or any part of the body exposed to the sun. Telangiectasia, scarring alopecia, and hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation may occur later. Other accompanying signs include conjunctival redness, dilated capillaries of the nail fold, bilateral parotid gland enlargement, oral lesions, and mottled, reddish blue skin on the legs.

**Recognizing Butterfly Rash![](Aspose.Words.c095f8e6-4e09-43bb-b8a0-d98824367885.132.png)**

With classic butterfly rash, lesions appear on the cheeks and the bridge of the nose, creating a characteristic butterfly pattern. The rash may vary in severity from malar erythema to discoid lesions (plaques).

- ***Erysipelas.*** Erysipelas causes rosy or crimson swollen lesions, mainly on the neck and head and commonly along the nasolabial fold. It may cause hemorrhagic pus-filled blisters. Other signs and symptoms include fever, chills, cervical lymphadenopathy, and malaise.
  - ***Polymorphous light eruption.*** Butterfly rash appears as erythema, vesicles, plaques, and multiple small papules that may later become eczematized, lichenified, and excoriated. Provoked by ultraviolet rays, the rash appears on the cheeks and bridge of the nose, the hands and arms, and other areas, beginning a few hours to several days after exposure. It may be accompanied by pruritus.
    - ***Rosacea.*** Initially, butterfly rash may appear as a prominent, nonscaling, intermittent erythema limited to the lower half of the nose or including the chin, cheeks, and central forehead. As rosacea develops, the duration of the rash increases; instead of disappearing after each episode, the rash varies in intensity and is commonly accompanied by telangiectasia. With advanced rosacea, the skin is oily, with papules, pustules, nodules, and telangiectasis restricted to the central oval of the face. In men with severe rosacea, butterfly rash may be accompanied by rhinophyma — a thickened, lobulated overgrowth of sebaceous glands and epithelial connective tissue on the lower half of the nose and, possibly, the adjacent cheeks. This is more common in elderly patients.
      - ***Seborrheic dermatitis.*** Butterfly rash appears as greasy, scaling, slightly yellow macules and papules of varying size on the cheeks and the bridge of the nose, in a “butterfly” pattern. The scalp, beard, eyebrows, portions of the forehead above the bridge of the nose, nasolabial fold, or trunk may also be involved. Associated signs and symptoms include crusts and fissures (particularly when the external ear and scalp are involved), pruritus, redness, blepharitis, styes, severe acne, and oily skin. Severe seborrheic dermatitis of the face occurs in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
- ***Systemic lupus erythematosus.*** Occurring in about 40% of patients with this connective tissue disorder, butterfly rash appears as a red, usually scaly, sharply demarcated macular eruption. The rash may be transient in patients with acute SLE or may progress slowly to include the forehead, the chin, the area around the ears, and other exposed areas. Common associated skin findings include scaling, patchy alopecia, mucous membrane lesions, mottled erythema of the palms and fingers, periungual erythema with edema, reddish purple macular lesions on the volar surfaces of the fingers, telangiectasia of the base of the nails or eyelids, purpura, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
  - Butterfly rash may also be accompanied by joint pain, stiffness, and deformities, particularly ulnar deviation of the fingers and subluxation of the proximal interphalangeal joints. Related findings include periorbital and facial edema, dyspnea, a low-grade fever, malaise, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lymphadenopathy, photosensitivity, and hepatosplenomegaly.

**Other Causes**

- ***Drugs.*** Hydralazine and procainamide can cause a lupus-like syndrome.

**Special Considerations**

Prepare the patient for immunologic studies, complete blood count, and, possibly, liver studies. Obtain a urine specimen, if needed. Withhold photosensitizing drugs, such as phenothiazines, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and thiazide diuretics. Instruct the patient to avoid exposure to the sun or to use sunscreen. Suggest that he use hypoallergenic makeup to help conceal facial lesions.

**Patient Counseling**

Urge the use of sunscreen, and stress the avoidance of sun exposure. Encourage the use of hypoallergenic makeup to conceal facial lesions. Inform the patient about sources of support such as the Lupus Foundation of America.

**Pediatric Pointers**

Rare in pediatric patients, a butterfly rash may occur as part of an infectious disease such as erythema infectiosum, or “slapped cheek syndrome.”
